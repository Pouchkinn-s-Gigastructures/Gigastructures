  giga_eawaf.1001.name:99 "The Blinking Star"
  giga_eawaf.1001.desc:99 "Ever since our species first began charting the stars - initially through primitive optical telescopes, then via orbital satellites, and now with tachyonic emitters - there have always been a number of systems behaving in unexpected ways.\n\nThe most common causes of confusion amongst our astronomers were usually variations in stellar luminosity and irregular exoplanet transit patterns, but as our understandings of physics grew, these mysteries were able to be properly assessed, analysed, and solved. Most of the time, they turned out to be little more than simple erroneous measurements by our primitive telescopes, and in the reminder of cases, the study of these phenomena allowed us to further enhance our understanding of exoplanets and stellar behavior.\n\nYet, despite the continuous perfectioning of our telescopes and our ever-increasing comprehension of the cosmos, one system in particular continues to utterly defy all models of astrophysics - the mysterious star referred to as §YFaust§!. While it might at first look like a regular - if dim - star, anyone spending more than a couple hours observing the system will notice the star seemingly just... disappearing, before reappearing again roughly twelve hours later, and again disappearing twelve more hours afterwards.\n\nDubbed the 'Blinking Star' by our astronomers, no theory has managed to explain the star's regular disappearance and it has become evident that the only way to pierce this mystery would be to go there ourselves. Fortunately, with the recent discovery of Faster-than-Light travel, such a direct investigation is at last within the realm of possibility, and the prospect of finally solving this mystery already has our entire scientific community abuzz with excitment."

With such a small size, it should by all accounts either be a neutron star or little more than a gas giant, and yet... there it is, dutifully orbiting around Faust in twenty-four hours, passing behind the planet every twelve hours and disappearing from view before re-emerging on the other side.\n\nWhile the 'Blinking Star' mystery is finally solved, it seems there will still be much work to do before we actually have any idea what is happening within this strange system."

However, many of these species, notably the more equine ones, display a variety of supernatural abilities, such as ludicrously efficient agriculture, flight or telekinesis, to name a few.\n\nSignificant deposits of the thaumaturgic crystals found in the system's asteroid belt have also been located all across the world, with some of its native species making significant usage of them in order to bolster and catalyse their natural abilities. This has led our scientists to believe the crystals and these abilities to be related in some way.\n\nInterestingly enough, we may be right in time to witness a turning point in the planet's history, as several species are reaching the point at which developments in experimental methods should allow them to tremendously increase their own understandings of both their abilities and the crystals. This is likely to have far-reaching consequences and might drastically alter their technological development.\n\nThe §Y[ROOT.GetName]§! reports that a small team has been deployed to the surface in order to hopefully gleam more insight into the workings of this peculiar multispecies civilization before a more permanent observation post is established."

These continents are incredibly diverse, with each of them harboring several distinct sapient species.\n\nWhile native species range from bipedal humanoids known as §YYetis§! to four-legged ursines known simply as §YBears§! and avians known as §YGriffons§!, a significant chunk of these species resembles equine creatures and have thus been dubbed §YEquineans§!.\n\nThis is however an umbrella term encompassing several species, such as particularly small yet thaumaturgically gifted §YPonies§! (which, alongside the Griffons, are by far the most populous species, being present on all three continents), the §YZebras§! adapted to desertic climates, the larger §YHorses§!, and the more outlandish §YKirins§! native to the easternmost side of Zebrica.\n\nHowever, perhaps the most interesting yet dangerous feature of Faust is the existence of several demigod-like entities roaming the planet's surface. Known as §YAlicorns§!, they are gifted with tremendously powerful reality-warping abilities and seem to act as the mostly-undisputed rulers of §YEquestria§!, the planet's most powerful nationstate.\n\nThe consensus amongst our expedition members is that the sheer power of these Alicorns means any invasion attempt of Faust would be §Rextremely ill-advised§!, and thus it is likely far safer to simply observe the world from afar."

As systems are constantly moving through space, our scientists concluded that there must be some sort of phenomenon causing this 'thinning' of reality, and set out to probe Helios itself to try and find answers.\n\nThanks to thermal-shielded probes diving into the depths of this esoteric inferno, it was found that at the core of Helios lies a miniature 'rift' in reality itself, supposedly leading directly into a realm of pure psionic energy.Matter from Helios' center regularly falls into this rift before re-emerging in the form of boiling superheated psionic energy. This energy then 'floats' up to Helios' hydrogen outer layers and triggers nuclear fusion reactions.\n\nThrough poorly-understood processes, the 'spent' psionic energy then 'coalesces' back into hydrogen nuclei, which are themselves ignited by fresh psionic energy. The fused helium nuclei, owing to their higher mass, then fall into the rift and the cycle repeats essentially indefinitely, thus keeping the miniature star lit!\n\nThe discovery and understanding of this esoteric process, now dubbed §YPsicatalyzed Fusion§!, has revolutionized both psionics and nuclear science. Consequently, many of our scientists are now debating whether it is possible to replicate this process ourselves in order to generate energy."

Hydrogen nuclei were then injected onto the emerging energies with perfect timing, triggering extremely powerful nuclear fusion reactions several orders of magnitude more powerful than those found within conventional fusion reactors, or even normal stars, for that matter.\n\nWith the initial experimental hurdle out of the way, the potential application for this technology are limitless. Not only does it generate significant quantities of energy, the more powerful fusion reactions could theoretically be used to create extremely heavy elements with far greater ease than current methods. Not only that, but the stabilized rifts seemed to produce a 'reality thinning' effect much like the one found on Faust, drastically improving the efficiency of psionics within its immediately vicinity.\n\nFollowing this resounding success, all that remains to be done now is to upscale the design to be industrially viable."

  # Sirens Event Chain
  giga_eawaf.2001.name:99 "The Depths Awaken"
  giga_eawaf.2001.desc:99 "Something is stirring on Faust's surface. Seapony explorers from §YHippogriffia§!, a nation located on the northwestern end of Zebrica, have recently undertaken an expedition into the depths of the §YMareiana Trench§!, one of the deepest, darkest chasms of Faust's vast oceans.\n\nWhen the explorers returned, something within them had changed. Some sort of mysterious presence had taken hold of them, as if their very souls had been enthralled. That presence began spreading to other Seaponies, taking a hold of their minds and spreading its influence across the nation of Hippogriffia.\n\nWithin mere weeks this influence had spread to the point of culminating in a relatively bloodless coup which saw the former Hippogriffian government overthrown and the instauration of the §YSirens§!, a trio of serpentine mind-controlling demons from the depths evidently behind the entire act, as the new rulers of the land which they now call §YSirenalia§!.\n\nFrom what our outpost could gather, these Sirens are seemingly driven by an intense desire for revenge over some long-forgotten catastrophe which had befallen their kind. It is thus evident that they do not intend to stop at merely Hippogriffia and are likely to try and spread their influence to the rest of Zebrica and potentially even all of Faust itself.\n\nThe task at hand is daunting, though. Already, a resistance group known as the §YAris Resistance§! and made up of notable Hippogriffian officials, including its former queen, has arisen to counter the rise of Sirenalia and end the Sirens' rule over their rightful land, and it is anyone's guess as to whether or not they will be successful in restoring the old order.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, it would be in our best interest to keep a close eye on this situation."

This song appears to be powered by peculiar crystals lodged within the Sirens themselves, although the actual mechanisms of this enthralling remain entirely unknown to us.\n\nThis ability is what allows the Sirens to actively impose their control, and already they are leveraging this power in order to try and secure several of Sirenalia's neighboring nationstates.\n\nWith Sirenalia possessing a particularly large navy as well as a powerful airforce, both inherited from the former Hippogriffian goverment, we estimate that the Sirens will have little trouble expanding their influence to the rest of Northern Zebrica within the coming years.\n\nAs for the rest of Faust, while some are expressing concern over the Sirens' growth, most are currently disregarding the Sirens as yet another empire doomed to inevitably meet its end at the hands of a future coalition."

Ultimately however, and with plenty of support from §YEquestria§!, the harmonic resistance stands victorious as the Sirens' order collapses in on itself and their enthralling magic, bereft of sustenance, simply fades away.\n\nA new, united Hippogriffian government has been established to restore the old status quo, while the whereabouts of the Sirens themselves is unknown. They have either perished in the fighting, or have returned to the depths of the oceans to once again gather power and perhaps bide their time in preparation for another attempt at planetary domination.\n\nBut for the foreseeable future, the Hippogriffians can rest knowing that the Sirens are no longer a threat, at least for the next few centuries."

While our scientists were originally rather confused as to why the Sirens decided to pick such a powerful enemy as their next target, further studies revealed that a group of individuals known as the §YPillars of Equestria§! seemingly caused the Sirens' downfall many millennia ago.\n\nOriginating from Equestria itself, these 'Pillars' were, against all odds, found to be still alive, and thus the Sirens appear to be determined to enact vengeance upon the Pillars for their previous banishment into the depths of the Mareiana Trench.\n\nThis upcoming war is certain to be one of tremendous proportions, likely the largest Faust has known thus far. Already the Sirens have taken to conquering more nations in key geographical locations, namely §YMaregypt§! and §YAbyssinia§! to their southwest, in order to use them as staging grounds for the future invasion of Equestria.\n\nGiven Equestria's power, many of Faust's inhabitants believe that this is likely to end in the Sirens' untimely demise, but the Sirens themselves seem determined to exe cute this ambitious plan to the end."

The Wingbardian navy definitely tipped the scales against the Sirens and it was only a matter of months before Sirenalia's core territories were under threat.\n\nAfter months of siege followed by several grueling offensives into Sirenalia's capitals, the Sirens, realizign their defeat was all but inevitable, fled the scene and disappeared once more into the depths of the ocean.\n\nWith the Sirens gone, whatever remained of Sirenalia's government quickly collapsed and its former lands were put under a reconstruction mandate tasked with overseeing the area's reconstruction and the total elimination of the few remaining fanatical pro-siren holdouts.\n\nThe Sirens' true whereabout are unknown, but they are unlikely to ever reappear for at least several centuries, and have thus been deemed to be permanently defeated by the majority of Faust's inhabitants."

Although the invasion was initially successful, Equestria managed to quickly mobilize its massive manpower reserves, using them to first halt, then repel Sirenalia's advances onto Equus.\n\nThis was followed by the launch of a vast, multi-pronged amphibious invasion of Sirenalia's heartlands to which the Sirens opposed incredible resistance, before being ultimately overpowered by the Equestrians' sheer industrial and military might.\n\nFollowing the complete capture of Sirenalia proper, Equestria's ruling Alicorns proceeded to capture the Sirens while they were attempting to flee. In order to ensure Sirenalia could never emerge again, the Pillars of Equestria alongside the Alicorns pooled their powers to banish the Sirens' very souls into the depths of the Immaterium, where they should remain imprisoned for at least several millennia.\n\nWith Sirenalia defeated and its rulers themselves banished from reality, the Sirens' hope of world domination have been definitively thwarted."

Across the world's surface, two billion sapients have fallen under the Sirens' enthralling spell, toiling endlessly to fuel Sirenalia's ever-growing industrial might.\n\nWith the entire world under their control, it seems evident that the next step for the Sirens might just be to take to the stars, although the means by which they would do so are unclear. Despite their powerful magic, Sirenalia is, as it stands, completely and hopelessly outmatched by even a fledging interstellar empire, and any attempts at expanding into space would likely be met with overwhelming firepower.\n\nFor now, our outpost shall continue to observe the Sirens, and shall inform our government and armed forces immediately should Sirenalia begin planning its expansion into space."

According to our readings, the energy contained within all of Faust's crystals would be sufficient to generate a thaumaturgic field extending not only across Faust's surface, but also over the entirety of its local planetary system as well.\n\nThere is no telling what the effects of this 'spell' might be, but everything is proceeding far too quickly for us to actually intervene.

Ships and transmissions sent to investigate the system simply disappear from existence, never to be seen again. The conclusion is clear: for the time being, the Faust system has essentially been removed from the galaxy, evidently as a result of the Sirens' plans.\n\nWhile it is uncertain if this strange shroud will ever dissipate, slight variances in its energy signatures seem to indicate that it might eventually disappear after roughly §Yone century§! has passed, although whether this turns out to be accurate or merely guesswork remains to be seen."

  GIGA_EAWAF_DISENCHANTER_1:99 "Prototype Disenchanter"
  GIGA_EAWAF_DISENCHANTER_1_DESC:99 "An early version of a device capable of countering the Sirens' enthralling song by emitting specifically-attuned energetic noise around the ship. These prototypes are unfortunately expensive and extremely power-hungry, requiring significant input of external energy and material in order to keep them running."
  
  GIGA_EAWAF_DISENCHANTER_2:99 "Tuned Disenchanter"
  GIGA_EAWAF_DISENCHANTER_2_DESC:99 "This improved and streamlined Disenchanter builds upon earlier prototypes to more efficiently counter the Sirens' song through energetic noise.
