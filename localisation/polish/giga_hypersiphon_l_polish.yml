  giga_hypersiphon.109.desc:99 "Preliminary analysis of the residue left behind by the Shroud invaders has yielded some insights into how our Shroud Conduits and Hypersiphons are affecting the ebb and flow of the Shroud.\n\nCareful application of safety measures and precisely executed rituals would allow us to mitigate the negative effects of our connection, but the extra care taken would reduce the economic benefits of our conduit facilities.\n\nAlternatively, we could disregard the damage being caused and instead focus on boosting our conduits by drawing in harvestable energies. This would improve the benefits of our conduits, but might cause negative reactions to occur more frequently."
