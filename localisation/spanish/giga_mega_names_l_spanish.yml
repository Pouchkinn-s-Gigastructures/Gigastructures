  kugelblitz_1_DESC:99 "This construct houses an artificial Kugelblitz as well as devices capable of injecting and extracting energy from it. The Kugelblitz requires a small amount of energy to keep the singularity stable, and to allow for continued safe storage of materials."
  
  kugelblitz_2:99 "Enhanced $name_kugelblitz$"
  kugelblitz_2_DESC:99 "This construct houses an artificial Kugelblitz as well as devices capable of injecting and extracting energy from it. Advances in super-scale technology have allowed for a much larger stabilized kugelblitz to be generated, thus allowing for a larger amount of storage."
  
  kugelblitz_3:99 "Grand $name_kugelblitz$"
  kugelblitz_3_DESC:99 "This construct houses an artificial Kugelblitz as well as devices capable of injecting and extracting energy from it. Utilizing tetra-dimensional engineering we're capable of an even higher increase in the amount of viable storage from a single generated kugelblitz."
  
  kugelblitz_ruined:99 "Ruined $name_kugelblitz$"
  kugelblitz_ruined_DESC:99 "A ruined $name_kugelblitz$. Built to house a controlled artificial singularity, this construct has suffered immense damage in the past, and is no longer operational. Albeit difficult, repairs might be possible."
