Examples included asking the Vester's head Blokkat out on a date, demanding to visit a Blokkat's female genitor (a failure made all the more humorous by the fact that Blokkats do not possess the concept of gender, or the concept of a genitor, for that matter), or outright running into recursive translation conversion loops which broke the device more times than the scientists could recall.\n\nWith little expectations, the head scientist inputted the sentence and activated the device, prompting it to power up and run the translation protocols, before returning the results..."
