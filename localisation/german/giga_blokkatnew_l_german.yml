Following further analysis of the Bureau's gathered data and thorough discussion, our leadership and science teams have brought forth several possible courses of action in order to deal with the Blokkats.\n\nThe first and most obvious one is to, like previously suggested, research and subsequently construct a massive device to bring down the shield, before utilizing our fleets to blast the Blokkat-Vester into nothingness, thus removing the Blokkat threat from our galaxy.\n\nAnother branch of our government argues that fighting is futile and that we should instead take the Blokkats' suggestion and assemble an §Yintergalactic arkship§! to safely evacuate our population from the galaxy and seek refuge elsewhere.\n\nLastly, a third and much more fringe branch suggests that, considering the Blokkats are obviously sapient and capable of intelligent thought, there might be a way to potentially... §Rjoin them§!, should we find a way to negotiate with these invaders.\n\nWhile the last option has been decried as utterly ridiculous by nearly every sane member of our government and scientific community, its supporters argue that allying with the Blokkats would ensure the eternal continuity and safety of our great civilization for eons to come..."

A test message was to be inputted into the device, which would then translate it to what should be Blokkatese, compare it with a sample 'sentence' retrieved from the Blokkwork, and then decrypt it back into our own language, and if everything was correct, it should return identical.\n\nThe Bureau's go-to test message had been §H'How many Blokks can a Blokkat Blokk?'§!, a sentence commonly found within the Blokkwork which highlights the inherent difficulty in properly translating conventional languages to Blokkatese in a way which makes sense.\n\nUnfortunately for them, they had only ran into innumerable issues with the translation protocols, which often ended up with the sentence turning nonsensical once translated to Blokkatese. Examples included asking the Vester's head Blokkat out on a date, demanding to visit a Blokkat's female genitor (a failure made all the more humorous by the fact that Blokkats do not possess the concept of gender, or the concept of a genitor, for that matter), or outright running into recursive translation conversion loops which broke the device more times than the scientists could recall.\n\nWith little expectations, the head scientist inputted the sentence and activated the device, prompting it to power up and run the translation protocols, before returning the results..."
