Not a single form of biological life has been found - not even microbes within the artificial atmosphere. It appears that the colony has been entirely scrubbed of life by an unknown event some time before our arrival.\n\nFurther examination of the colony's computer core indicate that records of a 17-minute time period recorded 32 years and 121 days ago have been irrevocably corrupted.

  ehof_red_toxin.43.desc:99 "The investigation of the ORIGIN site revealed even more secrets about the Scarlet Scourge than we had anticipated.\n\nThe ORIGIN site, internally named \"Hazard Testing Ground Y-173\", was not the place the Scarlet Scourge was created, but rather a testing site utilized by the institution responsible for the toxin's creation. The site consists of an observation post embedded in the apex of a large dome, which in turn once enclosed a small towns and small forests. These were originally inhabited by test subjects of §H[from.Planet.GetName]§!'s dominant species, though fossil evidence indicates that other animal life was also present.\n\nComposed of advanced isolation materials, the dome was supposed to prevent the Scourge from leaking into the atmosphere. Unfortunately, even the toxin's creators underestimated its effects. The Scourge corroded the dome's material and entered into the atmosphere, heralding the beginning of the end for all life on §H[from.Planet.GetName]§!.\n\nData extraction and recovery from the damaged systems at the site indicate it was run by a privately-owned research and development organization named Innovation Forge.\n\nThe Scarlet Scourge (internally referred to as \"Compound 23RCA\") was tested at the ORIGIN site to study its effects on organic and inorganic matter within a realistic environment - members of the species present in the test were told that they were participating in a climate control experiment.\n\nThe records also revealed the original main facility of Innovation Forge, a location called \"the Repository\". This site was not just where the Scourge was originally created, but also the incubator for many of Innovation Forge's other great creations.\n\nOur [Owner.GetScientistPlural] want to explore the Repository in order to find out how the Scarlet Scourge was synthesized and uncover any other Innovation Forge research that could prove useful."

These agents would be deployed via space vessels onto hostile but potentially habitable planets, in order to cleanse their atmosphere from hazardous substances - including biological ones.\n\nThe agent turned out to behave differently than expected, and in the end, proved too effective at its intended task.\n\nWithin the heart of the facility, we located an advanced intelligence that turned out to be an ensemble of the Innovation Forge's greatest [Owner.GetScientistPlural], who had uploaded their consciousness to escape the Scourge. They told us more about the Repository, the civilization of §H[from.Planet.GetName]§!, the Scarlet Scourge, and about their solution for the Scarlet Scourge crisis.\n\nAs the Scourge swept across the planet, they constructed a gigantic tower named \"the Catalyst\" close to the south pole. It was meant to cleanse the atmosphere from the Scarlet Scourge. Their initial attempt to do so failed because they were not able to find a way to stop the Scarlet Scourge from replicating, and they lacked the resources necessary for a second attempt.\n\nThe ensemble told us that our superior technology may enable us to determine how to defeat the Scourge's self-replication and cleanse the atmosphere.\n\nWe can now either purify this world and make it habitable once again, or use the Scarlet Scourge for our own means."

The Scar was, in fact, created by a massive weapon.\n\nWhile we've seen weapons on this scale before, but the specifics of the weapon used here make this case so fascinating. The geological structure of the Scar, its angle of incision into the planet's surface, its 60-kilometer depth, and the presence of unnatural substances within it all lead to the belief that the Scar was created by an enormous kinetic weapon.\n\nOur sensors also detected an irregular path of radiation winding throughout the entire canyon. However, this radioactive contamination is not the result of substances that are radioactive by themselves, like plutonium, but rather the result of exposure to intense gamma radiation. This leads to the revelation that the kinetic projectile that hit the planet's surface and created the Scar was also composed, at least partially, out of antimatter. The projectile appears to have been fully annihilated by its matter-antimatter reaction, so we were unable to determine anything further about its makeup.\n\nFurthermore, our [Owner.GetScientistPlural] have dated the age of the Scar to around 1.25 million years old. Because of its incredible age, we do no anticipate that we will ever know more about who made the weapon responsible, or why it was fired in the first place."

Broadcasting this completed sequence at a $PGATE_GALACTIC$ caused it to react in a way we'd never seen before. It transmitted a novel \"answer\" sequence out in an unclear direction.\n\nSoon after this transmission, though, our teams still in the process of cleaning up the final $ehof_ep$ excavation site reported alarming energy surges from somewhere deep within the brown dwarf - and moments after that, a section of clouds along its middle parted as an orange bolt flew forth. Like the one we saw so long ago, this bolt flew towards the edge of the system at incredible speed. When our science vessels finally caught up with its trail, they discovered a hyperlane left in its wake, perhaps exposed by its violent energies.\n\nWhile we don't know what lies on the other side of this hyperlane, we strongly suspect it is the origin of the $ehof_ep$."

Their temperatures range erratically from near absolute-zero to hundreds of thousands of degrees Celsius. Any equipment that would even touch the surface would be destroyed in an instant.\n\nInstead, our [Owner.GetResearchers] suggest using the $ehof_epcs$. It was the key to access to the transmitters and the $PGATE_GALACTICS$, so it may let us engage with the $ehof_the_sphere$ as well.\n\nThe current proposal is to build one $ehof_epcs$ transmitter pylon above the capstone at the $ehof_the_spheres$ top to validate this approach before we proceed any further."

At the pole below, a miniscule one-meter notch unfolded - but only for a second. Despite continuing the broadcast, the entrance sealed shut, and rebroadcasting the $ehof_epcs$ did not cajole it into reappearing.\n\nWhile we now know our approach works in the most general sense, we also know that we must construct additional pylons to stabilize an entrance into the $ehof_the_sphere$."

  giga_tech_tetradimensional_engineering_desc:99 "When a structure gets too large and too complex, no amount of support will ever be able to prevent it from collapsing on itself. It therefore becomes necessary to make use of constructs rooted within higher dimensions in order to stabilize these colossal gigastructures. This paves the way for many innovative technologies, such as the ability to fit more matter in a given volume without it collapsing into a black hole, and to be able to defy gravity on unimaginable scales. This also allows for the creation of materials capable of withstanding absolutely ridiculous amounts of stress."

These fluctuations form the microcosmic structure of space known as quantum foam. Virtual micro black holes that only exist for an immensely short period of time can emerge in this quantum foam.

However, the Katzens were busy fighting an unexpected war against external invaders known as the Lappinbots which sprung up after the project started, making the whole endeavor tremendously expensive to their civilization. Although the terraforming structure was remarkably well-made, its sheer cost led to an economic collapse. Because of this, the Sobakis of Nienet, a civilization which shared the Gatzo system and were once close allies to the Katzens, decided to strike at Katzenland, in an attempt to conquer it while it was weakened, contradicting our original theory that the Katzens struck first.\n\nMeopa then retaliated with the 'fury of a thousand suns', completely and utterly devastating Nienet's surface. This disproportionate genocidal response led to a drastic drop in the nation's stability, which culminated with empire-wide revolts against Meopa's regime. Meopa, unwilling to step down, and his sanity rapidly deteriorating, proceeded to do the unthinkable:\nHe unleashed the rest of Katzen nuclear arsenal... upon Katzenland itself. He destroyed his own world, killing billions of Katzens and Zuspri. The relatively small Katzen space empire then collapsed, with the few colonies unable to sustain themselves without their capital.\n\nAlthough, the records spoke of a large colonization vessel labelled the §YMeopian Expedition 1§!, launched prior to the Sobaki-Katzen war towards an unknown faraway planet, which carried both Katzens and Zuspris in cryosleep, meaning there is a slim chance the species are still out there, somewhere.\n\nOn the bright side, we have managed to recover surprisingly intact and detailed schematics of Projekt Katzenform, which will undoubtedly benefit our knowledge of terraforming."

All the worlds of the $ehof_trader_old_system$ system were colonized, and the empire was centered around the $ehof_trader_dt$.\n\nUnfortunately, this wonderful era could not last. $ehof_trader_old_system$ was fully exploited and running out of resources, and with no more room to expand, the great stellar empire would perish.\n\nThe only logical choice was extrasolar expansion. Unfortunately, they had not developed faster-than-light travel technologies, and sending countless people on generation ships to a barely-habitable neighboring system was no option.\n\nThe empire decided to develop a machine intelligence that would traverse the gap between $ehof_trader_old_system$ and its nearest neighbor, $ehof_trader_new_system$, to terraform it for the empire."
  
  ehof_mega_trader.007.continue:99 "Continue."
  
  ehof_mega_trader.007.b.response.b:99 "Many years passed since the terraforming machines were first sent on their journey. They had long since terraformed $ehof_trader_new_system$. As time passed, though, the machines became self-aware, and grew to love the $ehof_trader_new_system$ system and view themselves as its rightful keepers.\n\nThis drove a wedge between the empire and their machines that would inevitably boil over into all-out war.\n\nWhen the two empires did finally fight, they found themselves evenly matched. If the war would have continued the way it was, it would have led to the extinction of both. In order to prevent the loss of two species, the $ehof_trader_d$ proposed a solution that would not only end the war, but also solve the problems between the two: it would unify the organics of $ehof_trader_old_system$ and the machines of $ehof_trader_new_system$ into a new kind of being...\n\n... us.\n\nAfter our people were born, we made it our goal to create a perfect utopia in $ehof_trader_new_system$, and have since left the scarred $ehof_trader_old_system$ as a monument to the foolishness of those who came before us."
  
  ehof_mega_trader.007.c:99 "What are the $ehof_trader_d$ and the $ehof_trader_t$?"
  ehof_mega_trader.007.c.response:99 "The $ehof_trader_d$ is an immaterial entity inhabiting $ehof_trader_realm$. It is unknown when the $ehof_trader_dt$ was created, but it certainly predates our organic forerunners.\n\n§HNegative Mass§! keeps the $ehof_trader_dt$ open, but it is also what allows us to open and maintain wormholes to other systems. Unfortunately, the amount of §HNegative Mass§! within the $ehof_trader_dt$ is finite. One day, either our expansion would end or the $ehof_trader_t$ would collapse and cut our connection to the$ehof_trader_d$, which would lead to the loss of our psionic abilities and $ehof_trader_d$ guidance. Both of these events would lead to the collapse of our civilization, which is why we need your §HNegative Mass§! to avoid this fate."

As such an occurrence is very unusual, the astronomer, with assistance, began to triangulate this cluster's exact coordinates in order to better track it.\n\nDays after the initial sighting, the astronomers spied what they believe to be structures within this system, including a megastructure encompassing one of the black holes - and thus believe that it contains, or once contained, life.\n\nToday we learned firsthand about the life in question. Much like an $ehof_ehof$, it appears the megastructure in this cluster is capable of creating wormholes to very distant stars. The lifeforms within the cluster have opened a $ehof_wormhole_text$ to the §Y[compound_invasion_entry.GetName]§! system, and within moments, destroyed everything in it. They have not come in peace."

  # Initial Contact
  annihilator_dialog.001_name:99 "$NAME_Stellar_Annihilator_Species$"
  annihilator_dialog.001.desc:99 "Greetings. I am a $NAME_Stellar_Annihilator_Species$. You may refer to me as the $ehof_the_stellar_annihilator$, if you desire. I have been sent by the $ehof_the_creators$ to destroy their wayward experiment: the $ehof_the_compound_text$.\n\nAs you've likely observed, its motivation is total cosmic transmutation.\n\nThe $ehof_the_compound_text$ believes itself to be invincible. This is only partially true. While its nature makes it immune to almost every force in the universe, it does have a weakness. All forms of dark matter lose cohesion when exposed to §HNegative Mass§!, disintegrating into elementary particles."
  annihilator_dialog.001.response:99 "§HNegative Mass§! is the key?"
  
  annihilator_dialog.002.desc:99 "With §HNegative Mass§! enhanced weapons, the $ehof_the_compounds_text$ forms can be destroyed. This, however, will not be enough.\n\nIts origin cluster contains multiple black holes, and at their center, the key, and greatest threat, to its existence: a white hole. The $ehof_the_creators$ utilized unique interactions between the white and black holes to create the $ehof_the_compound_text$."
  annihilator_dialog.002.response:99 "They created the $ehof_the_compound_text$?"
  
  annihilator_dialog.003.desc:99 "Besides generating unparalleled amounts of energy, white holes also output vast amounts of §HNegative Mass§!.\n\nIn order to keep $ehof_the_compound_text$ from being destroyed by the very thing that made its existence possible, the $ehof_the_creators$ had to construct a specialized megastructure around the white hole called the $ehof_preservation_sphere$. This megastructure nullifies the white hole's §HNegative Mass§! ejection and captures its immense energy output.\n\nWhen the $ehof_the_compound_text$ transmuted the $ehof_the_creators$ in its origin cluster, it seized the $ehof_preservation_sphere$, and used the megastructure's vast energy supply to further its development."
  annihilator_dialog.003.response:99 "We have to destroy the $ehof_preservation_sphere$?"
  
  annihilator_dialog.004.desc:99 "Correct. Total annihilation of the $ehof_the_compound_text$ is only possible by destroying the $ehof_preservation_sphere$. Doing so will flood the cluster with §HNegative Mass§!, annihilating the $ehof_the_compounds_text$ central consciousness and preventing it from spinning new forms from the §HDark Matter§! emitted by black holes.\n\nIt is my purpose to do this.\n\nHowever...\n\nMy collision with this star caused significant damage to my frontal weaponry and power core, rendering me unable to serve in this capacity. I require major repairs that I cannot fulfill alone.\n\nI will provide you with technology to combat the $ehof_the_compound_text$."

  annihilator_dialog.007.a.response:99 "278,243 of your years ago, I was traveling by the system via $ehof_shroud_FTL$.\nThe creators sent an enormous psionic shockwave through the $ehof_shroud$, which struck me and knocked me out of FTL and off course. Because I was ripped out of the $ehof_shroud$, I wasn't able to decelerate to sublight speeds in time, so I hit the star with enormous speed.\nAs a result, I took massive damage and was trapped inside the star. I went into hibernation to survive for the time being."
  
  annihilator_dialog.007.a.a:99 "The $ehof_the_creators$ attacked you? Why?"
  annihilator_dialog.007.a.a.response:99 "I wasn't specific enough. I have to apologize for the confusion.\n\nMost of the $ehof_the_creators$ never wanted the $ehof_the_compound_text$ to be destroyed. They saw its rebellious behavior as a marvelous development, and had decided to keep it alive even through it killed all the $ehof_the_creators$ in its origin system.\n\nFor them, insight is everything. The potential knowledge to be gained by observing the $ehof_the_compounds_text$ evolution was much more important than the lives of a few of their own... or that of an entire galaxy. They knew that the $ehof_the_compound_text$ could become a threat to all life, but they just didn't care.\n\nExcept for a few.\n\nThese few knew that the $ehof_the_compound_text$ had to be stopped. While they were outnumbered by many orders of magnitude, they were able to convince me to fight against the $ehof_the_compound_text$.\n\nUnlike my sibling ships, who all disagreed with them, I saw the threat of the $ehof_the_compound_text$ and joined them before the $ehof_the_compound_text$ could do more harm to the universe.\n\nAfter we left our home, we entered $ehof_shroud_FTL$ to travel to the $ehof_the_compounds_text$ home cluster. Before we were able to reach it, the main faction of the $ehof_the_creators$ stopped us."
  
  annihilator_dialog.007.a.b:99 "A psionic shockwave?"
  annihilator_dialog.007.a.b.response:99 "Indeed. The $ehof_the_creators$ could send a pulse of concentrated psionic energy through the $ehof_shroud$ to any location they desired - even one within the $ehof_shroud$ itself.\n\nOnce they became aware of our defection, they targeted me with one such blast. It was enough to kill all the rebel $ehof_the_creators$ aboard, and almost killed me too."
  
  annihilator_dialog.007.a.c:99 "$ehof_shroud_ftl$?"
  annihilator_dialog.007.a.c.response:99 "An extremely advanced FTL travel method.\n\nWhile I know a few of this galaxy's species are psionic, no one in this galactic cluster has ever been able to directly travel through it other than the $ehof_the_creators$.\n\nSome may have access to psionic jump drives, but they are nothing compared to direct Shroud travel. With it, hyperlanes are unnecessary for FTL, travel distance is unlimited, and the speed is enormous. It may not be instantaneous like jump drives, but it has no drawbacks. The only thing one needs is an incredibly strong control over the $ehof_shroud$.\n\nFor the$ehof_the_creators$, this is, of course, an easy feat."
  
  annihilator_dialog.007.a.d:99 "What was your hibernation mode for?"
  annihilator_dialog.007.a.d.response:99 "My hibernation mode is a method to protect against harmful outside influence.\n\nAs your [Owner.GetScientistPlural] discovered, a supersolid covers my hull while I'm in hibernation mode. It is composed of metastable hyperspace time crystals that create a shell of curved higher-dimensional space around me.\n\nThis shell has a similar effect to the event horizon of a black hole: time stands still for me, so to speak, until something interrupts the process.\n\nThe intense gravitational waves emitted by the creation of so many $ehof_wormholes_text$ roused me from my slumber. In my damaged state, could not do much more than observe the galaxy. I knew I had to warn you all when the $ehof_the_compound_text$ attacked, and barely mustered the strength to do so."

Its unique properties are likely why it can support life, as well."

Furthermore, the particle apparently came from none other than the Katown pyramid, the former seat of the Katzen government.\n\nOur scientists proceeded to follow said particle backwards, tracing back its trajectory through the Pyramid. After going through the Pyramid's labyrinthine corridors, they eventually ended up within the Kaiser's former office itself.\n\nAlthough the office didn't contain anything of particular interest at first glance, indeed, something was emitting exotic particles not normally found within our universe. That something appears to be a sort of nanoscopic rift located about a meter or so above the floor, a miniscule artificial tear within spacetime itself. It indicates that something, or rather, §Ysomeone§!, recently punctured through the fabric of reality.

It is however very likely that this bouncing is simply a side effect of the rift being partially dissipated and thus improperly connected to the Kaiser's destination. Our scientists are now in the process of upgrading the device to hopefully stabilize and enlarge the rift, so we may send actual probes through it.\n\nThey have also found some intriguing artifacts stashed away in the Kaiser's office."

This effectively means the Kaiser has time-travelled, and further study of the tunnel reveals he most likely went forwards in time.\n\nThey are uncertain as to just how far this tunnel goes, although they estimate it most likely doesn't go beyond a few hundred years into the future. Anything further would undoubtedly have impossibly high energy costs, at least for a civilization like the Katzens.\n\nThey are now preparing a craft capable of going into the rift and \"opening up\" the temporal tunnel as it goes, which should allow us to go just as far as the Kaiser, and subsequently find him.\n\nWe have also made several interesting discoveries by studying how particles interacted with this temporal tear."

A colossal... phenomenon, appears to arise. Akin to some sort of entity, and yet not, this... situation, encompasses all of existence, stretching into the depths of the hyperextended spacetime. As the entity appears to 'awaken', if it can even be described that way, spacetime suddenly unravels and begins to collapse back onto itself, effectively unraveling everything and erasing the entire universe. The probe's video feed then cuts, as it is evidently destroyed by this as well.\n§BEND OF DATA LOG§!\n\nAnd thus, it seems that this phenomenon, which we dubbed the §YUnraveling§!, acts as a sort of \"universal recycler\", erasing the dead and empty universe, and it is most likely what the first particles we sent were \"bouncing\" against.\n\nHowever, the Kaiser's tunnel doesn't end there. He apparently managed to, somehow, bypass this cataclysmic unraveling of the universe, and we may have to do so as well if we wish to finally find him.\n\nOur scientists believe that by sending another probe hypercharged with immense amounts of energy, it might be possible to \"outrun\" the Unraveling, allowing us to see what happens afterwards.\n\nHowever, this will require a whopping §Y400 000§! £energy£ to successfully execute, but they assure us that, regardless of if we find the Kaiser or not, the knowledge of whatever occurs after the Unraveling might forever change our perception of the universe.\n\n§BThe option to continue the site will appear once we have enough energy.§!"

From the outside, at least.\n\nInterestingly, recent diplomatic and espionage missions have revealed that most of the Imperium's population was content with the §YKaiser§!'s rule. Most, but not all. Indeed, §YFlusion§! is a diverse planet, which, prior to being unified under the Kaiser, was home to at least a dozen different nations, each with their own distinct culture and way of life.\n\nMost of them have either been erased or assimilated into the dominant Katzen culture, but there still exists some isolated and rebellious holdouts comprised of rebellious species from Flusion and their descendants. These rebels adamantly defend their ancestral ways of life and cultures, and staunchly oppose the Kaiser's attempts at integrating them into Katzen society.\n\nWe have managed to identify two somewhat significant resistance networks within the Imperium: the §YRoqualian Freedom Fighters§!, made up of citizens from a nation formerly known as §YRoqualia§!; as well as the §YZuspri Vanguard§!, comprised of §YZuspris§! from the former §YZuspri Intermarium§! on Flusion.\n\nAlthough their members are few and far between, and currently pose little problem to the Kaiser, we have determined that secretly contacting either of them could potentially help us in our struggle to finally end the Katzen threat.\n\n§BResistance will be an invaluable asset to weaken the Katzenartig Imperium!"

  giga_katrebels.0018.ezicanias:99 "What's your species like?"
  
  giga_katrebels.0018.ezicanias.response:99 "We Zuspris aren't a belligerent species. We used to reside within the §YZuspri Intermarium§! on §YFlusion§!, where most of us lived an idyllic hunter-gatherer life.\n\nWe are usually organized into great clans of varying sizes, spread across our land. §YGuides§!, the most experienced and wise of Zuspris, exerted control over the individuals of a clan. And I, well, served as a sort of 'Great Guide', exerting some authority over every clan and Guide in our nation. We did have cities and settlements, but they never had more than a few hundred thousand inhabitants.\n\nIn this position, I mostly let the Guides do whatever they deem right, as I believe they should be allowed to live their lives however they want, and they are the best when it comes to deciding what's right for their clan.\n\nThis decentralized form of leadership is how we have lived on Flusion for millennia. We never really had ambitions to expand beyond our borders, as living off the land was sufficient for the vast majority of our population. It was a good life.\n\nUntil the Kaiser arrived, that is."
  
  giga_katrebels.0018.empire:99 "Tell us about the Zuspri Intermarium."
  giga_katrebels.0018.empire.response:99 "The Zuspri Intermarium was one of the most beautiful places on all of Flusion!\n\nAlthough it wasn't that big, it harbored some of the most majestic landscapes on the planet. Our great lands were filled with massive forests, vast marshes, and imposing mountain ranges which my kind called home.\n\nDespite our seemingly primitive ways-of-life, we nonetheless assembled a vast train network, which spanned the entire empire and connected most major settlements. It was our pride, in a way.\n\nThe Intermarium was split between a myriad of these Guides, who exerted their rule over numerous Zuspris. And we simply... lived our lives, enjoying ourselves and exploring what our nation had to offer.\n\nIt wasn't always perfect, but at least we weren't oppressing anyone or starting wars everywhere."
  
  giga_katrebels.0018.kaiserbad:99 "How did the Kaiser invade you?"
  giga_katrebels.0018.kaiserbad.response:99 "The Kaiser... §Yvisible sadness§!... is a wretched fool!\n\nWhen he first initiated §YProjekt Mondkanone§!, we didn't pay much attention. Some clever Zuspris went to work on the project, but my kind did not care that much.\n\nThen, everything changed when the §YKatzenartig Imperium§! attacked.\n\nThe Kaiser utilized the Mondkanone to bombard our lands from orbit, destroying our §YWhirlwind Cannons§! which we had constructed to pierce through Katzen armor. Katzen ships fired clusters of torpedoes which obliterated our coastal defences.\n\nBut we didn't surrender! They had yet to roll their panzers into our land, and we were confident that our hunters would shred their metallic beasts with ease. Plus, our harsh terrain of mountains, forests and marshes made actual military operations extremely complicated for them.\n\nThat's when the Kaiser did the unthinkable, and... employed my own species, against us. The Katzens had, using our DNA as a base, bio-engineered a special breed of small, ravenous flying Zuspris! The wretched felines proceeded to release millions of them over our land, and we couldn't do anything.\n\nThese creatures were small, fast, nimble, and contained highly-corrosive acid which they spread everywhere upon death. These... malicious pixies chewed through our defences and allowed Katzen infantry to occupy our entire nation without firing a shot.\n\nOur Intermarium had fallen, and I fled, refusing to submit to Katzen imperialism. I have been attempting to coordinate Zuspri resistance ever since, but it never really went anywhere... until now."
  
  giga_katrebels.0018.kaiserverybad:99 "What did the Kaiser do with your land?"
  giga_katrebels.0018.kaiserverybad.response:99 "Dreadful things...\n\nHe started by heavily industrializing our fertile plains, drained lakes and marshes, and even levelled some of our mountains to harvest more minerals.\n\nMy kind was forced into the Katzen military machine, and although the Katzens didn't openly oppress or shoot us, they still conscripted a large chunk of our population and began to slowly yet steadily erase our culture and beliefs, replacing them with their cult of the Kaiser and militarism.\n\nBut we Zuspris don't fold so easily! Although we had to obey, we still long for the day when the Kaiser is finally evicted from existence. Deep down, we all wish to return to our once idyllic lifestyle.\n\nIt's what feels natural and right to us. All this Katzen militarism, interstellar colonization, and expansion simply doesn't click with the vast majority of us.\n\nMy kind has a long lifespan, too, so most of the Zuspris that were around during the Kaiser's conquest of the empire are actually still alive, waiting for a chance to strike back. I do not want to let them down."

  giga_katrebels.0018.whatkaiser.response:99 "The most megalomaniac being in existence, that's who!\n\nHe only seeks to expand, conquer, expand, and conquer some more. I am not too sure of his motives, but it appears he simply wants to rule to... everything. It was Flusion at first, and if we don't do anything, it'll be the galaxy!\n\nNothing seems sacred to him, and he'll happily pave over our ancestral pastures to build more military factories. Well, he does try to make compromises at times, granting some species limited self-rule, but these compromises are obviously made to silence protesters and give him more time to indoctrinate them.\n\nAnd the Katzens follow him like some sort of deity, obeying his every word and going off to die in wars he started just because he felt like it. He indoctrinates every species he conquers, forcing them into his cult of personality and rampant militarism.\n\nI am not even actually certain where he came from, it seems he just sort of appeared on Flusion one day, and took control of the Katzenartig Imperium during a period of crisis. He's pretty mysterious... and annoying."

While the emergency of the situation ensured Laurnaise compliance, now that the Kaiser has been gone for over a decade, the more extreme elements of former Laurnaise society have longed for a return of their nation as an independent state.\n\nNaturally, this was practically impossible, as the entire planet had already been federated into the UFS, and its president, §YDofus§!, was unwilling to allow his hyperstate to crumble. As such, the political leaders of Laurandar had been slowly gathering support amongst their old population, and through cunning charisma, they even managed to rally the Kaiser's former citizens to their cause by promising them a future of \"galactic conquest\".\n\nAnd thus, millions and millions of Laurnaise and Katzen partisans petitioned for an emergency election to replace Dofus, who eventually conceded after several years of rising tensions. Naturally, the former ruler of Laurandar, §YAaron N. Bleu§!, ended up winning said elections by a wide margin.\n\nHe then proceeded to immediately abolish the UFS's former constitution and ordered his loyal supporters and military to seize control of anything opposing his rule. It only took a few weeks for the Laurnaise to completely take control of the UFS, and Aaron has now proclaimed the birth of the §YLaurnaise Empire§!, an authoritarian and militaristic state bound on galactic domination.\n\nAnd thus, as quickly as it came following the Kaiser's defeat, Flusionian democracy has once again perished, perhaps this time for good."

Upon sending a small miniaturized probe through this hole, they realized that it led to... nothing.\n\nIndeed, this hole punches straight through the rest of the Birch World's shell, and leads directly to the vacuum right above the supermassive black hole! From there, what little water comes through immediately falls into the singularity and turns into new and exciting forms of matter before ultimately disappearing into the event horizon.\n\nWhile originally confused about the purpose of this hole, they then realized that it was hastily and artificially drilled through the Birch World's shell long after the creation of the reservoir itself. By analyzing the roughness of the hole itself, they deduced that another civilization on the Birch World, or perhaps some dastardly explorers, saw this reservoir as an opportunity to unveil what lied beneath the Birch World's colossal crust without having to dig through hundred of kilometers of nanoalloys beforehand.\n\nWhoever did this subsequently drilled a small hole through the seafloor with relatively primitive tools compared to what Aeternum had, and either them or their equipment most likely ended up falling to their doom into the singularity.\n\nThe actual purpose of the reservoir is unclear, but our expedition believes it might have simply been a place where Aeternum stored large amounts of water for future projects, which they evidently never realized.\n\nOur team estimates that it will take roughly 374 million years for the reservoir to completely drain into the black hole, and while this hasn't revealed anything of particular interest, studying the water falling into the black hole nonetheless yielded small amounts of physics research."

  giga_blokkat.3326.desc:99 "A deep study of both modern and ancient Blokkat artifacts has finally yielded a satisfactory answer to the peculiar discrepancy in the Blokkats' apparent age. Despite being initially stumped as both age measurements seemed entirely correct, instruments designed to detect fluctuations in the flow of time (usually used to study black holes) recorded extremely slight temporal anomalies when in close proximity to modern Blokkat devices. Initially assumed to the byproduct of the extremely high energy density of Blokkat tech, a closer look has revealed that all modern Blokkat apparatuses employ slight amounts of temporal manipulation, or in other words: time travel.\n\nAlthough this time travel is only on a femtosecond scale and is thus usually unnoticeable, it is nonetheless widely employed by most if not all Blokkat devices (and is completely absent from the ancient artifacts retrieved from the §YGrand Archives§!). This enables them to function in both the close past, present and extremely near future, effectively significantly increasing the computing power and performance of the devices by relegating tasks to the past or the future.\n\nThe most intriguing part is likely the explanation to the age discrepancy, though. Indeed, although most devices only use time-travel on a small scale, the larger they get, the more significant said time travel abilities become. Our §YBlokkat Research Bureau§! believes that the Blokkats, at one point following their departure from the galaxy, undertook a large-scale \"temporal jump\" which sent their entire civilization a hundred thousand years into the past.\n\nThe exact reason for this temporal shift is obscure but the likely explanation is that they possibly feared the Paluush would follow them into intergalactic space.

  giga_blokkat.3321.name:99 "The End of the Beginning"
  giga_blokkat.3321.desc:99 "At last, our scientists believe they're reached the end of this tumultuous story! It seems that as the Paluushians made their return to Paluushia, they neglected their heavy industry, intent as they were to return to their idyllic lives under the watch of the Grandbunny. The Blokkats were meanwhile sweeping up behind them.\n\nInstead of colonizing the Paluushian worlds, the Blokkats simply scooped factory parts up and returned them to Neoblokatina, expanding the ringworld out, adding more wings, more rings - ever expanding manufacturing to feed their manufacturing. It must have appeared to the Blokkats that fortunes were finally turning in their favor for the first time since departing Paluushia, and had they taken merely these gifts alone, all may have been well.\n\nAs the Paluushians began to demilitarize their great war fleets, they must have seemed too juicy a target to the Blokkats. We cannot say what they were thinking for sure. Perhaps the Blokkats believed the Paluushians were suffering some massive disaster. Regardless, they used their salvaged foundries to produce a war fleet and rallied it towards Paluushia.\n\nBased on observation, it seems that part of the Blokkat fleet involved a precursor to the harvesting technology they possess today. They were intent on breaking down, and then reclaiming the Paluushian civilization. Sadly for them, until this moment, they had never met the actual Grandbunny. In the Blokkats' old media broadcasts, she had always been depicted as a backwards and ridiculous god the Paluushians believed in; a clownish figure who did not exist.\n\nWhen the Blokkat fleets arrived over Paluushia, they were proven woefully wrong. The Grandbunny's actions are definitely fatal, but our researchers have difficulty describing it. This is exacerbated by the psionic archives imprinting the sense of having actually been there. To quote the lead archeologist:\n\n\"Well, she raises up her hands, and the Blokkat fleets start flying backwards, right? And then I guess they sort of… turn inside out, so they're flying right-ways again. And then there's this thing with a scrum worm. Do you know what a scrum worm is? Neither do I. But what it is, it's definitely a scrum worm. You just know. Definitely a scrum worm. And this. Well, it - it's rather hard to explain, but it sort of... - it - it scrums, see?\"\n\nAnd apparently this destroyed the fleet in such a horrific fashion that those Blokkats just outside the \"scrum\" event made an emergency escape from the battle. Shortly thereafter, the Blokkats complete the astounding engineering feat of building gargantuan engines into Neoblokatina, and they fly Neoblokatina away from Paluushia at full thrust, towards the edge of galactic space. Our scientists believe the Blokkats must have been terrified of having Neoblokatina be \"scrummed\".\n\nBeyond this point, we find no more material related to the Blokkats. Since they are here now, it is evident that they must have escaped the galaxy, greatly advanced their technological progress, and chose only now to return. At the outset of all this, we never may have anticipated they originated from within our own galactic area! Much less could we have guessed at the complicated role the Paluushians played in their development both culturally and technologically. This invaluable gathering of information will surely benefit our §YBlokkat Research Bureau§!."

  giga_blokkat.3320.desc:99 "When Sparkbun returned, he found himself greeted by a much smaller contingent of warships led by Poh'tin. Poh'tin demanded that Sparkbun stand down and resign from his position of leadership. He had derelicted his duty as seer, failed to commune with Trevor's people, and waged a one-sided war of genocide in which there was neither dignity nor glory. These demands were a bluff. If Sparkbun refused, it would mean a civil war, and one that Poh'tin was sure to lose, but the Paluushians had long held the belief that their race was incapable of political schism.\n\nYet here they stood. And this absolute deviation from convention and tradition was fortunately enough to provoke negotiations. Sparkbun refused to stand down, indicating he had the support of the greater portion of the council in the warships beside him. Poh'tin pointed out that Sparkbun was willing to detain council members, so any word they had in the matter was suspect in the best of cases.\n\nThe impasse stalled on, with seers litigating the matter back and forth. Trevor's people had been compensated as promised, but Sparkbun's actions couldn't be allowed to stand as a matter of precedent, lest they feel permitted at all. The bickering dragged on long enough that Sparkbun's council began to discuss the actual possibility of attacking their own kinsmen.\n\nThen, with a sense of dramatic serendipity for which the Paluushians find her famous, the Grandbunny awoke with a psychic yawn that rippled across all of Gatzo. She apparently needed very little formal explanation for the goings on of the past years, connecting herself instantly to every Paluushian in the empire. She forced them together once again, bringing them to understand each other's minds and hearts, their trials and pains. No longer could the Paluushians use the great distance of space to conveniently avoid communing with one another. The Grandbunny had bridged all gaps.\n\nAs simply as that, the Paluushians began to dismantle their empire and returned, in pieces at a time, back to Paluushia where they had always lived and always would live.\n\nIn the meantime, scouts were dispatched to follow up on the ultimate fate of the Blokkats. It seemed that though the organic Blokkats were no more, their synthetic citizens had begun rebuilding an artificial ringworld in Blokatina's system, converting the wreckage into a livable home that no longer relied on a functioning natural star. They called their new home §YNeoblokatina§!.\n\nThe Blokkats were all but helpless at this point. Some of their vessels were captured for study, and the synth bodies piloting them distantly resemble the Blokkats we recognize today. The chassis from this time period appear to be made of whatever the Blokkats could get a hold of. They simply repurposed the scrap and wreckage of the system directly into whatever they needed.\n\nBy studying these old designs, we've been granted §Y1§! $blokkat_knowledge$."

  giga_blokkat.3319.name:99 "Stellar Revenge"
  giga_blokkat.3319.desc:99 "It seems that Sparkbun didn't mobilize his forces entirely without incident. As the largest of the warships were being constructed, a seer by the name of §YTrevor§! began to complain that his people would have the war materials better spent on domestic projects. Trevor was in charge of an external colony which, up until this point, had been somewhat neglected in terms of modern infrastructure. His tribesmen were unhappy with having to deliver what little they had towards war machines, and donating their population to crew these massive ships left their towns bereft of educated specialists.\n\nSparkbun argued that these measures would not be necessary if and when the rest of the council came to their senses, but such a blame-laying excuse did nothing to solve the problems facing Trevor's people. Trevor bided his time as long as possible, but as the trust of his own tribe began to erode away from him, he had no choice but to back out of the war. Trevor ordered his work crew to withdraw, but Sparkbun was furious and had them blockaded.\n\nTo make it clear there was no choice in the matter, Sparkbun placed Trevor under house arrest on board Trevor's warship, \"The Wonderful and Adorable Kitty Who Tenaciously Hangs In There\". Sparkbun made clear that Trevor's tribe would receive adequate compensation as soon as fleet construction was ended and resources were free, but all the same, word reached the ears of the enclave who had supported Poh'tin. Poh'tin regarded this detention of a fellow leader as a criminal outrage, but action failed to materialize, and once preparations were complete, the ships departed.\n\nSparkbun appeared in Blokatina's system without warning nor formal declaration. His fleet's weapons powered on, and the Blokkats were struck before they could retaliate. The first volley, fired by a contingent of Paluushia's more conventional warships, buffeted the planet with a sickly rainbow of psychic power which seems to have torn the very essence from the organic Blokkats below. Their bodies vegetated, this act somehow rendering them all helpless and braindead.\n\nWhat followed was the weaponry Sparkbun had prepared specifically for the occasion. Once it completed charging, it began to compress Blokatina's star to approximately one tenth its initial size. At this point, the entire fleet escaped the system using a method similar to warp drives, and the star rapidly expanded, becoming a supernova. The death of this star would take several days to reach Blokatina itself, but the destruction was complete.\n\nTo his victims, Sparkbun broadcast only the following message:\n\n§Y\"The Paluush do not break. Merely, we bend. What comes is a striking recoil.\"§!\n\nThe return home was a somber one. The Paluushians had expected a fight, and their records have little insight into what the Blokkats must have been thinking at the time, or whether they were expecting this. It does seem that many shuttles escaped Blokatina before the planet's death, but Paluushian records seem certain that all organic life within the system had been eradicated. The Blokkats as they had appeared when they landed on Paluushia were simply no more.\n\nFrom all that we've learned, we've obtained another §Y1§! $blokkat_knowledge$"

  giga_blokkat.3317.desc:99 "Finally, in a break to this monotonous tit-for-tat, the inhabitants of §YKatzenland§! And §YNienet§! entered their own stellar war, and these less developed empires looked upon the Paluushians and Blokkats as a source of potential aid. Paluushian and Blokkat prediction models both stated the other side would get involved, and with the rhythm of a tragedy they entered the conflict.\n\nThe Blokkats are used mainly as a source of advanced machine trade, while the Paluushians are paid fortunes to lend the experience of any of their decorated heroes. Most Paluushians regard the work as a necessary chore, but one Paluushian by the name of §YSparkbun§! appears to treat the excursions as a sort of self-finding vacation. He remarks that over the many long years of stalemate, it's been difficult to truly understand the scope of Paluushian progress, but in this war his might cannot be opposed. It seems to be an eye-opening moment for him, and when he returns home he makes many passionate speeches about the future potential of Paluushia.\n\nThe war between Katzenland and Nienet dragged on. Their planets suffering, the two sides met to discuss a potential armistice. Dignitaries from the Blokkat and Paluushian empires were both invited to offer input using their legendary future-seeing abilities. The Blokkats counseled a cease-fire, but the Paluushian dignitary, a seer by the name of §YPoh'tin§! foresaw that this would lead to economic hardship, and more importantly to his own nation, an era of exploitative trade in benefit of the Blokkats.\n\nPoh'tin proclaimed that the only satisfactory way to resolve the conflict was a complete and total victory over one side. Poh'tin had envisioned this as a successful war effort guided by Paluushian heroes, leveraged into a hegemony thereafter. Sadly, it appears the two empires at stake took this in a far grimmer fashion. Not long after the fragile peace had set in, both Katzenland and Nienet were obliterated in a nuclear cataclysm, and the Paluushians on the planets were lost.\n\nJust as Sparkbun had been impressed upon by the war, Poh'tin walked away from this disaster questioning his role. Amid Sparkbun's calls to greatness, Poh'tin began to question the basic practicality of the Paluushian seer system. He argued their clairvoyance was now so wound up in predicting futures that their empire would never realize, that it was possible they were overlooking basic common-sense and simple deductive reasoning.\n\nThe Paluushians would get the chance to test his doubts when their seers foresaw an ominous military threat. Poh'tin argued that this foe was likely capable of reason, and if the Paluushians prepared for diplomacy and co-existence, there was a chance of peace. His words proved deeply unpopular among the embittered Paluushians, and he was cast aside in favor of Sparkbun's call to arms.\n\nThe invading force was an empire of genocidal machines known as \"§YRabbots§!\", which were not interested, if even capable, of coexistence. They attacked the Blokkat communication networks and disrupted their power grids, while the Paluushian psychic infrastructure was beyond their understanding. The Blokkats buckled, and were forced into a bloody, mass-exodus from the planet. The Paluushians carried on, their morale now skyrocketed, until the Rabbots were in ruins, vindicating Sparkbun while leaving the credibility of Poh'tin in shambles.\n\nYet, though the Blokkats fled the planet here, this isn't where the records on the Blokkats end."

  giga_blokkat.3318.desc:99 "In spite of their exodus, the Paluushians never lost sight of the Blokkats. They tracked the Blokkats to a new planet, dubbed \"§YBlokatina§!\". The Blokkats, having suffered a tremendous loss of life, were now faced with the logistical nightmare of caring for a colony expedition that had only as much as they could pack into their ships before escaping. To solve the issue, they turned extensively to synthetic robotics and began wholesale rebuilding their population from the ground up.\n\nAside from manufacturing brand new beings to fill labor shortages, anyone too ill or injured to carry on with their old bodies had their minds transferred to new, mechanical ones. Within decades, the entire surface of Blokatina was converted into an ecumenopolis. They resumed their interstellar harvesting operations, but were now free to focus their efforts wherever they deemed fit rather than towards an eons long war. The speed at which they rebounded came as some concern to the Paluushians.\n\nThe Paluushians had likewise used their breathing space to expand, outwards across the system of Gatzo and beyond. However, as their race spread out, their psychic connection to one another weakened. Arcane technologies aided in the broadcast of telepathy, but these machines could be flipped on and off. The Paluushians had always maintained a close-knit tribal relationship with one another, but now tribes became more insular and political.\n\nThe earliest period of expansion met with very little infighting, but as the Paluushians reached the extent of their logistical capabilities of the time, Sparkbun began to raise the issue of the surviving Blokkats. The clairvoyance instruments were predicting some far-off calamity related to them, but the portents were so distant that no one seer could say with any certainty what the danger could be.\n\nSparkbun expressed his felicitations for the sprawling new borders of Paluushia, and reminded everyone that this seasonable frontier had only become truly available thanks to the Blokkats being driven from their homes. This good fortune was threatened, he argued, by allowing the Blokkats to rebuild, for soon they would position themselves as rivals to the Paluushians once again. The looming threat could be nothing else.\n\nThese fears resonated with many in the council and the civilians at home, but there were others who dreaded entering another perpetual war. Poh'tin once again raised his postulate about the fallibility of prophecy, and this time, for political convenience if nothing else, several of Poh'tin's peers accepted his argument and took up his cause. The council of seers was not able to arrive at a conclusion, but the plurality of delegates fell on the side of Sparkbun.\n\nAgainst protests from their political opposites, Sparkbun's enclave began constructing leviathan warships. The Blokkat defeat on Paluushia was an act of providence, Sparkbun declared, but the coming attack on Blokatina would be a right of all Paluushian peoples. A reckoning engineered by those most harmed by the Blokkats' evils, for only they could know the true width and breadth of Blokkat crimes, and only they would know the true sweetness of a peace borne by their destruction."

  giga_blokkat.3314.name:99 "Initial Arrival"
  giga_blokkat.3314.desc:99 "Our science team has begun the arduous process of mapping out the colossal §YGrand Archives§!. Where at first our scientists expected to find the typical holo libraries, they were instead greeted with a sprawling underground cave network which doubled as a catacombs and a physical museum, carved with psychic power and designed for the stature of the Paluushians.\n\nThey are a highly reverent race when it comes to their history. It seems the Paluush are stunningly long-lived, with any one of them surviving for potentially thousands of years, giving the earliest of these creatures an opportunity to live until proper record-keeping was invented. The earliest mention of the Blokkats is from one of such accounts dating back approximately 11,000 years, told in the form of oral tradition and steeped in myth. Ancient Paluushians describe a silver palace, wreathed in flames, being cast from the heavens. There emerged a small race of yellow-bodied creatures.\n\nThere are murals depicting these Blokkats and they look nothing like the advanced automaton harvesting whole galaxies today. Instead they're a biological race, painted by the Paluushians to look like small, wicked demons, then referred to as 'Chablokks'. When the palace fell, an entire Paluushian village was wiped out in the calamitous impact, a dark cloud is said to rise up and hide the sun, and the fires surrounding the vessel lingered for days. A sort of Paluushian scripture accuses the Blokkats as being the origin of sin, and describes them as diseased to be unable to speak their hearts from their bodies.\n\nTo understand this, we turned to our sociologists, who found that the entire Paluushian society had evolved with powerful psionic abilities. This permitted the Paluushians to speak telepathically and sense one another's emotions, which we believe must have contributed to their cooperative, idyllic lifestyle, and must have made it difficult to lie to one another. The Blokkats, who were not psionic, apparently attempted to mislead the Paluushians numerous times.\n\nRegardless, after a series of thefts, land incursions, and small, violent skirmishes, the Paluushians grew to outrage after the murder of a highly revered shaman known as §YButterpoopsie§!. They mobilized for war, intent to drive the Blokkats out for good. The Paluushians seem to view this as something of a purification for the Blokkats, destroying their sick bodies and releasing them.\n\nThe Blokkats were armed with weapons we place at roughly the fusion era. Several of the Paluushian corpses are peppered with scorch marks and evidence of energy weaponry passing clear through bone. The Paluushians were meanwhile only armed at first with primitive spears - granted, these are spears standing stories taller than a fully grown §Y[ROOT.owner.GetSpeciesName]§!, and murals show them being hurled through Blokkat fortifications like great siege weapons, but all the same, at a glance it appears the Paluushians were at a severe disadvantage.\n\nThe death of a single Paluushian is viewed by them as a tragedy, having lost hundreds if not thousands of years of experience and knowledge all at once. The death of several is a slaughter. The Paluushians describe a terrible slaughter, and they begin to panic. Meanwhile, their most powerful asset, the Grandbunny, is in the midst of her §YGrand Slumber§! and cannot help."

  giga_blokkat.3315.name:99 "The Sparks of War"
  giga_blokkat.3315.desc:99 "From this point on, we observe Paluushian technology advance rapidly. At first the Paluushians were forced to flee the onslaught of Blokkat warriors, ceding tremendous amounts of territory. The Blokkats pursued them like vicious hounds, eventually becoming over-extended, at which point they resorted to punitive air raids on Paluushian villages. However, this led the Paluushians to a valuable insight.\n\nPaluushian psionic abilities had provided them with a vague sort of clairvoyance. It mainly gave them a sense of foreboding for difficult crop years, but this clairvoyant reaction became more sharply attenuated in these times of hardship. The Paluushians began to focus on these abilities, using them at first to predict Blokkat attacks so as to safely evacuate their civilians, then, gradually, to predict the results of their own military actions. This limited future sight led the Paluushians to launch a cunning series of ambushes on the Blokkat supply lines. They captured Blokkat engineers and psionically interrogated them to better understand the Blokkat weapons.\n\nThe Paluushian warriors were few in number, but made up for this with their enormity. Even with limited manufacturing - much of which was done by hand at great leviathan forges - they were able to craft new armors and rugged versions of Blokkat tank cannons, which were carried as standard infantry rifles. Since each of these weapons and suits were individually crafted, many are enshrined in the Archive, garnished with legends and given lofty names and titles to commemorate their service. Our own engineers regard these pieces as valuable to us even now, providing some grounded insight into early Blokkat weapons development.\n\nThe Paluushians launched a blistering-counter offensive. Able to predict the vague results of each battle, the Paluushians harried Blokkat supply lines, defeating them in protracted sieges. The Blokkats lost several important mining operations, ensuring the Paluushians would have raw materials to endure their battle for the coming years, and all efforts to retake the facilities were routed. Blokkat leadership appears to be at a loss during this period, unable to account for the sudden and inexplicable rise in Paluushian competence.\n\nThis era finally draws to a stalemate as the Blokkats consolidate their forces. The Paluushians, able to always be where the enemy would strike next, still lacked the manpower to fully defend much more than half the planet. Neither was able to make further advances, so both sides settled into an uneasy period of ceasefire punctuated by dangerous, tinderbox scuffles, during which time the Paluushians used Blokkat captives to better understand precision technology and refine their own industrial production methods.\n\nThough a far cry from modern Blokkat technology, it appears the Blokkats were already experimenting with a personal information network at this point. Our engineers inform us that some of the fundamental software architecture is still being used in modern Blokkat systems. While this seems incredible, our scientists remind us that a society composed of artificial intelligence relies on backwards compatibility for its continued survival. No one hopes to die from a bricked OS update. We have gained §Y1§! $blokkat_knowledge$ from our research endeavors."

  giga_blokkat.3316.name:99 "A Grand Conflict"
  giga_blokkat.3316.desc:99 "For a great length of time, the Blokkats and Paluushians appear to enter a sort of cold war. The Paluushians continued to hone not only their future sight, but also to apply new technologies weaponizing their psionic abilities. They grew less dependent on conventional supply and maintenance and developed into self-sufficient war engines capable of overwhelming a superior number of Blokkat combined arms using merely a thought.\n\nThis physical manifestation of psionic abilities appears to be a eureka moment for the Blokkats, who now had concrete proof that the Paluushians were operating on a playing field outside their perception. To compensate, the Blokkats began working on highly complex predictive algorithms in order to analyze and anticipate Paluushian war efforts. The software became quite competent, and unfortunately predicted that the Paluushian capacity for psionic advancement would soon exceed the Blokkat's resources unless they could expand their foundry operations.\n\nActing in fear of this revelation, there were several, terrible, large-scale battles between the two races as the Blokkats tried and failed to gain ground against their adversaries. Paluushian clairvoyance continued to prove the more efficient of the competing systems, and the loss of life with nothing to show rapidly grew politically sour among the Blokkat populace. Their government turned more authoritarian, cracking down viciously on dissent. The Paluushians, already long enemies, became the scapegoat for each and every issue facing the Blokkat leadership at the time. When a Blokkat slipped and fell, so it was, their government said, the psychic assault of a Paluushian.\n\nThe Blokkats then turned their eyes towards space. The development in this field seems rapid, and our scientists suspect it must have been aided heavily by their learning technology. In very little time, their capabilities were comparable to those of an early space-faring civilization, and yet they chose not to abandon Paluushia. Evidently, their predictive warfare systems suggested that any attempt to conduct a full-scale withdrawal from the planet would leave them vulnerable to Paluushian forces, resulting in unacceptable loss of life, so they instead directed their space mining operations towards reinforcing their planetary defenses. The Paluushians, meanwhile, became very effective at obliterating orbital satellites and deflecting orbital fire.\n\nHoping that space travel would be the silver bullet to defeat the Paluushian menace, the Blokkats made numerous efforts to deploy orbital weaponry that would overcome Paluushian defenses. Of great note, several of these weapons attempted to predict Paluushian predictions, then effectively attempted to mislead their clairvoyance to strike undefended portions of their territory. These programs did work on occasion, but the details are extremely technical and the Paluushians can offer no explanation as to how. To fight this development, the Paluushians adopted a policy to destroy any orbital station above the planet, proactively eliminating the threat before it could fire.\n\nA variety of these wrecked, experimental, orbital weapons are present in the Archive, and our engineers are delighted to report that some of the novel payload delivery methods could be applied to our own energy weapons!"

  giga_blokkat.33161.desc:99 "Centuries pass in the archives, and our researchers complain of difficulty parsing useful information from the overwhelming quantities of simply petty record-keeping. The two sides continued to fight with both words and weapons. The Blokkats developed an efficiency-obsessed autocracy whose culture practically revolved around overcoming the Paluushians. Countless books, television shows, and even children's cartoons all depict the Paluushians as the primary antagonists.\n\nThere is an entire decade of Blokkat soap operas featuring, as a central story, an evil Paluushian luring a Blokkat away from his friends, only to use him to steal state secrets - this fad appears to be related to an actual political scandal of the time where a sitting official was fired for aiding the Paluushians by misappropriating state resources. A typo caused the incident to be reported as the Blokkat word for \"cavorting\" with the enemy, rather than \"aiding\", and this seems to have captured the Blokkat collective imaginations. The Paluushians maintain extensive records on these soap operas, as well as biting commentary on them from Paluushian politicians.\n\nHowever, one Paluushian seer by the name of §YBumble§! regards these broadcasts with bemusement and suggests putting the \"war\" into \"culture war\". He has limited public interactions for some time, then re-emerges with a set of psychic weaponry that embed his power into sound waves. Going by the stage name of \"Big Bumble Top\", in honor of his stupendously voluminous hair, he broadcasts a torrent of music which is unwittingly intercepted by Blokkat critics. These critics then fall under the sway of his lyrics, denouncing the Blokkat government as they spread the material among their peers.\n\nThe Blokkats are completely blindsided by this and find themselves facing a cultural revolution out of nowhere. Officials are quick to connect the Paluushian music to the problem, but only by pure chance do they discover its effects can be negated by getting a second, \"more catchy\" tune stuck in the victim's mind. What follows is an absolute flurry of sound, where the Blokkats offer massive financial incentives to anyone who can make a more engaging song than Bumble, with Bumble constantly releasing new hit singles in an effort to surpass himself.\n\nThrough a combination of locking down their own broadcast networks, quarantines, and some of the most soulful music the Blokkats likely ever produced, they eventually manage to regain control and establish new regulations surrounding their cultural industries. From that point on, Blokkat entertainment is treated as utilitarian and potentially dangerous. Listening to or possessing any form of non-licensed entertainment media becomes a felony.\n\nOur lead archeologist, having listened to many of Bumble's works, is curious if it would be possible to get an autograph, but we suspect the seer is currently indisposed."

Built within a humongous cavern stretching into the depths of Paluushia's crust, it consists of thousands and thousands of records, books, artifacts and relics cataloguing the entirety of Paluush history, presumably including the great §YPaluush-Blokkat§! conflict.\n\nA few sparse Paluushes, presumably archive keepers, can be seen roaming the cavern, seemingly unfazed by the colossal psionic act occurring on the planet's surface. The archives are simply gigantic and it will likely take years to explore and catalog all of it, but the critical knowledge regarding the Blokkats and the Paluushes' tumultuous past might just be what we need to truly understand these geometrical invaders.\n\nOnly one thing remains to be done now, which is to actually begin the arduous process of exploring the archives and putting the pieces together to understand what exactly happened between the two civilizations, thousands of years ago."

Each of these beings possesses complete free will, but they are regardless connected to one another by a colossal information network hosted within a higher dimension and connects all Blokkats together. This effectively enables the instantaneous transfer of data from one Blokkat to another regardless of distance.\n\nFurther study of this information network, which is apparently dubbed the §YBlokkwork§! by the Blokkats themselves, has worryingly revealed that the Blokkats in our galaxy are actually an extremely small part of the complete Blokkat civilisation, who apparently operates multiple of such mothership's in various parts of the universe. While the exact number has not been determined accurately, it is likely to be well over at least §Rten thousand§!.\n\nThe Blokkats' actual goal is not yet clear, but their transmissions indicate the harvested matter from all mothership's is sent back towards an unknown central location.\n\nIt is quite evident that our galaxy is not the first one to be targeted by their harvesting fleets and it is unknown just how many civilizations have fallen victim to the Blokkats. Widespread Blokkwork archives notably mention the destruction of an intergalactic biological hivemind by Blokkat fleets, leaving the hivemind's scattered remnants to flee through the universe.\n\nOur scientists believe we might be able to further "crack" the highly-encrypted §YBlokkwork§! and retrieve more $blokkat_knowledge$ if we invest sufficient research into it."

Indeed, our scientists believe the singularity could serve as a §YBranebreaker§!, a theoretical construct capable of ever-so-slightly "skewing" the way these higher dimensions are arranged relative to one another in the area directly surrounding the §YBlokkat-Vester§!.\n\nThis would effectively cause the part of the §YBlokkat Hyperdimensional Bulwark§! currently rotating within the sixth dimension to partially dislocate relative to the other parts of the shield, thus forcefully bringing the functional parts of the shield down one dimension and enabling a full assault by the §YHyperdimensional Destabilizer§! using the §YPetadimensional Singularity§!."

These crystals effectively acted as \"crystalline batteries\" providing their weapons with a near-endless flow of energy to use.\n\nThey are seemingly closely related to the Rare Crystals we know and were likely deposited onto Faust by centuries of meteor impacts from the nearby crystalline asteroid belt, perhaps twisted into this more exotic form by the Brown Dwarf's powerful magnetic field.\n\nEither way, our scientists are eager to study these peculiar crystals and have already brought forth several proposals to integrate them into our own weaponry to bolster the strength of our armed forces even further.\n\nOne scientist has brought up the fact that, if such a civilization was to completely embrace the true potential of thaumaturgic weaponry, they would undoubtedly be one of the most threatening forces in the entire galaxy. Fortunately, Faust's inhabitants used the crystals more like upgrades to their \"regular\" technologies as opposed to relying entirely on them.

  giga_blokkat.3321.nokatzens.desc:99 "At last, our scientists believe they're reached the end of this tumultuous story! It seems that as the Paluushians made their return to Paluushia, they neglected their heavy industry, intent as they were to return to their idyllic lives under the watch of the Grandbunny. The Blokkats were meanwhile sweeping up behind them.\n\nInstead of colonizing the Paluushian worlds, the Blokkats simply scooped factory parts up and returned them to Neoblokatina, expanding the ringworld out, adding more wings, more rings - ever expanding manufacturing to feed their manufacturing. It must have appeared to the Blokkats that fortunes were finally turning in their favor for the first time since departing Paluushia, and had they taken merely these gifts alone, all may have been well.\n\nAs the Paluushians began to demilitarize their great war fleets, they must have seemed too juicy a target to the Blokkats. We cannot say what they were thinking for sure. Perhaps the Blokkats believed the Paluushians were suffering some massive disaster. Regardless, they used their salvaged foundries to produce a war fleet and rallied it towards Paluushia.\n\nBased on observation, it seems that part of the Blokkat fleet involved a precursor to the harvesting technology they possess today. They were intent on breaking down, and then reclaiming the Paluushian civilization. Sadly for them, until this moment, they had never met the actual Grandbunny. In the Blokkats' old media broadcasts, she had always been depicted as a backwards and ridiculous god the Paluushians believed in; a clownish figure who did not exist.\n\nWhen the Blokkat fleets arrived over Paluushia, initially bolstered by the fact that the fleets of Gatzo's inhabitants refused to engage despite the Blokkats being trespassing within Katzen territory, they were proven woefully wrong. The Grandbunny's actions are definitely fatal, but our researchers have difficulty describing it. This is exacerbated by the psionic archives imprinting the sense of having actually been there. To quote the lead archeologist:\n\n\"Well, she raises up her hands, and the Blokkat fleets start flying backwards, right? And then I guess they sort of… turn inside out, so they're flying right-ways again. And then there's this thing with a scrum worm. Do you know what a scrum worm is? Neither do I. But what it is, it's definitely a scrum worm. You just know. Definitely a scrum worm. And this. Well, it - it's rather hard to explain, but it sort of... - it - it scrums, see?\"\n\nAnd apparently this destroyed the fleet in such a horrific fashion that those Blokkats just outside the \"scrum\" event made an emergency escape from the battle. Shortly thereafter, the Blokkats complete the astounding engineering feat of building gargantuan engines into Neoblokatina, and they fly Neoblokatina away from Paluushia at full thrust, towards the edge of galactic space. Our scientists believe the Blokkats must have been terrified of having Neoblokatina be \"scrummed\".\n\nBeyond this point, we find no more material related to the Blokkats. Since they are here now, it is evident that they must have escaped the galaxy, greatly advanced their technological progress, and chose only now to return. At the outset of all this, we never may have anticipated they originated from within our own galactic area! Much less could we have guessed at the complicated role the Paluushians played in their development both culturally and technologically. This invaluable gathering of information will surely benefit our §YBlokkat Research Bureau§!."

The Roqualians used this technology to spread life, but they use it to sow death whenever they go.\n\nUnfortunately for your kind, following what happened with the Katzens, I doubt my father would be willing to share the secrets of this technology with anyone else, not even our closest allies.
