  giga_dialog.3005.a:99 "What's in those databanks?"
  giga_dialog.3005.a.response:99 "Oh, many things. My makers stored plenty of data about the various empires and species they knew about, their scientific knowledge, and most importantly, their deity §BQubey§!.\nThey wanted to preserve it so future generations could benefit from it, and, well, since you're here now, I guess they succeeded in this task. Too bad they're not here to see it anymore..."
  
  giga_dialog.3005.b:99 "How old is the Squareworld?"
  giga_dialog.3005.b.response:99 "Well, judging from the position of the stars, I estimate that this thing's been broken for about 120 000 of your years, but it is much older than that.\nIt was built about 567 000 years ago by my makers, and housed their civilization for many millennia. I'm not sure what happened to it, as I was unfortunately completely captivated by my research. The most likely possibility is that their civilization collapsed from decadence or simply grew too old and divergent, just like many other great empires before them."
  
  giga_dialog.3005.c:99 "Who built the Squareworld, and why?"
  giga_dialog.3005.c.response:99 "My makers did. They were a species of §R(DATA CORRUPTED)§!, known as the §R(DATA CORRUPTED)§!, and they ruled over a rather large empire, the §R(DATA CORRUPTED)§!\n\nThey were incredibly religious too, and worshipped a deity they called §BQubey§!. This deity was said to have helped their species evolve over million of years, and many saw the perfection of geometrical shapes as §BQubey§!'s way to manifest his presence to the world.\n\nMy makers eventually discovered an incredible substance, possessing unrivaled self-repairing properties. They dubbed it 'Quberine', as they believed the substance was made out of §BQubey§! himself, and decided to use it to construct this magnificent physics-defying geometrical structure as a way to both worship and show their gratitude towards §BQubey§!\n\nThey also took the opportunity to pack as much data about their scientific advancements, Quberine, the Squareworld, and §BQubey§!, into the databanks, in hopes that a future civilization stumbling upon it may learn of the almighty §BQubey§! as well."
  
  giga_dialog.3005.d:99 "Can we somehow repair the Squareworld?"
  giga_dialog.3005.d.response:99 "Hopefully yes! The mostly-functional archives contain a lot of data about the Squareworld's internal and external structure. If you give me a few dozen months to compile it all, I can give your scientists a data cache containing all the necessary information to conduct extensive repairs on the megastructure. I'd love to see the Squareworld restored to its former glory!"
  
  giga_dialog.3005.e:99 "Goodbye."
  giga_dialog.3005.e.response:99 "May the archives serve you well, and don't hesitate to contact me again if you need to know anything."

  giga_dialog.3006.desc:99 "Shortly before we logged off, §YGaryx§! has assured us that he will send us a data cache containing all the necessary information to repair the squareworld in about 2 years.\n\nIn the meantime, we may contact him again by 'upgrading' the Squareworld Hub Megastructure. Our scientists believe that his ability to easily navigate the Squareworld's databanks may greatly contribute to our research."
  giga_dialog.3006.a:99 "Acknowledged."
  
  giga_dialog.3007.name:99 "Garyx, Keeper of the Squareworld"
  giga_dialog.3007.desc:99 "Greetings, once again. I have finished compiling a data cache containing all the necessary information to repair the Squareworld! I will transfer it to your scientists immediately."
  giga_dialog.3007.a:99 "Wonderful! We shall make good use of this knowledge."

  giga_dialog.3008.a:99 "Can you help our research?"

  giga_dialog.3009.name:99 "Garyx, Keeper of the Squareworld"
  giga_dialog.3009.desc:99 "Why yes! I can peruse the Squareworld's archive for data you might find useful. What kind of data do you want me to retrieve?"
  giga_dialog.3009.a:99 "General £physics_research£ §YPhysics Research§!"
  giga_dialog.3009.a.response:99 "Alright! I will retrieve data related to your physics research, which will grant you a §Y10% increase§! to your research speed in that category.\n\nIf you wish for me to boost a different field, simply contact me again and pick a different option."

  giga_dialog.3009.d:99 "Nevermind, do not help our research."
  giga_dialog.3009.d.response:99 "Alright, I will stop helping you in your research, if that's what you want..."
