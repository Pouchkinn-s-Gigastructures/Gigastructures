  ehof_travel.1002.1.DESC:99 "§H[from.GetName]§! received a transmission of the $ehof_epcs$. It is the first transmission we've detected since the initial one years ago. §H[from.GetName]§! detected the transmission inside the §H[fromfrom.solar_system.GetName]§! system. Like the initial transmission, it disabled the ships main systems. The ships $ehof_closed_modular$ were able to restore the ships functionality, but the process still took about two hour, which is longer than anticipated. The systems may need additional modification to work more efficiently.\n\nThe $ehof_ep$ scanners were able to identify the source of the transmission inside the system, the toxic world §H[fromfrom.GetName]§!. The exact location on or inside the planet needs to be determined by an investigation.\n\nThe $ehof_ep$ scanners might be able to locate the source. Based on the fact that the transmission was only broadcasted for a short amount of time and has not been broadcasted since, it may take some time to locate the source."
  ehof_travel.1002.2.DESC:99 "Another transmission of the $ehof_epcs$ has been received inside the §H[fromfrom.solar_system.GetName]§! system, by §H[from.GetName]§!. Just like the last two times, the ship was disabled by the transmission, but this time, its $ehof_closed_modular$ were able to restore the ships functionality within only a few minutes. Much faster than the last time.\n\nThe $ehof_ep$ scanners were able to identify the source of the transmission inside the system, the shattered planet §H[fromfrom.GetName]§!. The exact location on or inside the planet needs to be determined by an investigation.\n\nThe $ehof_ep$ scanners will be able to locate the source, but it'll take some time to do so."
  ehof_travel.1002.3.DESC:99 "§H[from.GetName]§! received another transmission of the $ehof_epcs$, inside the §H[fromfrom.solar_system.GetName]§! system. The ships functionality has been restored and the location of the source determined. The frozen planet §H[fromfrom.GetName]§!\n\n. The exact location on or inside the planet needs to be determined by an investigation."
  ehof_travel.1002.4.DESC:99 "Another transmission of the $ehof_epcs$ has been received inside the §H[fromfrom.solar_system.GetName]§! system, by §H[from.GetName]§!. The ships functionality has been restored and the location of the source determined. The molten world §H[fromfrom.GetName]§!.\nThe exact location on or inside the planet needs to be determined by an investigation.\n\nThe $ehof_ep$ scanners will be able to locate the source, but it'll take some time to do so."
  ehof_travel.1002.5.DESC:99 "§H[from.GetName]§! received another transmission of the $ehof_epcs$, inside the §H[fromfrom.solar_system.GetName]§! system.

The exact location on or inside the planet needs to be determined by an investigation."
  ehof_travel.1002.6.DESC:99 "Another transmission of the $ehof_epcs$ has been received by §H[this.GetName]§!, inside the §H[root.solar_system.GetName]§! system.

  ehof_travel.1004.DESC:99 "An entrance is not identifiable to $ehof_the_sphere$, if there is any, but it may be similar to the amplifier objects, whose entrances only 'manifest' under specific conditions.\n\nAn intense study of the structure will be necessary to determine its function and to find a way into it, which will probably be necessary to determine the function in the first place. Our researchers decided to name the construct $ehof_the_sphere_named$."
