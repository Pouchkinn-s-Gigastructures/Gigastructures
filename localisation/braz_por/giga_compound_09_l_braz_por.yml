  compound_situation.3.title:99 "Searching for Solutions"
  compound_situation.3.desc:99 "The $ehof_the_compound_text$ is a seemingly-unstoppable threat - but we've seen enough in this universe to know that there's always an answer somewhere, somehow. They must have a weakness.\n\nWe will build many ships with different experimental weapons, and fight until something works."
  compound_situation.3.a:99 "Research with guns, not labs!"
  
  compound_situation.4.title:99 "Weakness Found"
  compound_situation.4.desc:99 "We did it! We managed to find an elusive weakness of the $ehof_the_compound_text$ - one that even they might not be aware of. It turns out that $ehof_sr_negative_mass$ can harm them! Unfortunately, our mastery over this technology is limited, and we are only able to come up with smaller weapon designs. These should be enough to buy us more time, at least."
  compound_situation.4.a:99 "This'll do nicely, good job everyone."
  
  compound_situation.5.title:99 "We Failed to Find a Weakness"
  compound_situation.5.desc:99 "Even though we tried our best, we simply failed to find and exploit any meaningful weakness in the $ehof_the_compound_text$. There is not much time left, and the leaders of our empire have begun to lose hope in overcoming this crisis."
