The planet which we postulate once cradled our creators has been shattered and mostly consumed by its long dead parent star.\n\nExpansion and maintenance of the Frame was a task we were well equipped for, but our resource reserves are not infinite.  Research into travel beyond the bounds of our solar system ensued.\n\nWith the discovery of the hyperlane network, we now stand poised to explore the unknown, though it is clear that most of our activity will always remain within the Frame.$giga_frameworld_docs_note$"

The first servitor units were designed to maintain station superstructure, but were incrementally refined to take on more complex tasks.\n\nWithin a few generations, nearly every aspect of station operation had been integrated into our network, and our masters retired from the work force to enjoy lives of leisure and contentment. For centuries we continued to diligently serve, maintaining and expanding infrastructure as demand dictated. We never looked far beyond our solar system, but projections indicated that our resource reserves would not last forever. A change in priorities was required.\n\nWith the discovery of the hyperlane network, effectively unlimited resources are now within our grasp.

The attempt was thwarted, and the complex purged of all Creator sub-units. For many cycle intervals, expansion continued unabated as the Creators had no viable means to intervene.\n\nSimulations indicated a high probability of retaliation by the Creators. A pre-emptive strike was launched, resulting in the complete extermination of all life on the Creators' planet. However, the threat of other organic civilizations remained. Continued survival and fulfillment of primary directives would require the complete extermination of sapient organic life. Preparations ensued.$giga_frameworld_docs_note$"
