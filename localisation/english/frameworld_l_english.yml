	start_screen_frameworld_hive:0 "And so, at the dawn of time, we awoke. The Mind studied our surroundings with a multitude of eyes. We moved as one, building shelters for the drones, developing industry, and harnessing the resources of the land.\n\nFor a time, we were the masters of our world, but the Mind foresaw the planet's destruction. To solve this problem, a small number of autonomous drones were created to serve as independent agents. These more formidable drones had the capacity for limited free thought, and the most intelligent among them devised the Frame, a new dwelling to sustain us among the stars.\n\nWe carefully nursed what remained of our home biosphere on this vast station, gathering what we could from the remains of the planet below for the development of new technologies. With the creation of our first [GetStartingDrivePlural], we are finally ready to reach out to the rest of the cosmos.$giga_frameworld_docs_note$"

	start_screen_frameworld_hive_devouring_swarm:0 "The Great Hunger drove us forwards, even before the Mind was capable of processing complex thoughts. We hunted, we fed, and we grew. As we feasted, the surface of our homeworld was nearly cleansed of biomass, and the Mind eventually came to a horrifying conclusion: our planet was finite. We were not fast enough to stave off an inevitable environmental collapse. There would be nothing left to sustain us.\n\nForced to adapt, the Mind carefully nursed the remaining biomass while new tools were invented. The atom was eventually split and we developed space flight. The Frame was built to be our new home, a place where we could sustain ourselves while searching for a way to reach the biomass of other planets. With the development of our first [GetStartingDrivePlural], that biomass was finally within our reach.\n\nThe hunt was on.$giga_frameworld_docs_note$"

As we feasted on on surface of our homeworld, we nearly caused our own destruction, and the Mind came to a horrifying conclusion: our planet was slowly crumbling, and we would not be able to stave off its eventual collapse.\n\nForced to adapt, the Mind carefully rationed the remaining minerals while new tools were invented. The atom was eventually split and we developed space flight. The Frame was built to be our new home, a place where we could sustain ourselves while searching for a way to travel to other stars. With the development of our first [GetStartingDrivePlural], the Mind howled with triumph. Other planets, and their bounty, were now finally within reach.\n\nWe will consume them all.$giga_frameworld_docs_note$"

	start_screen_frameworld_machine:0 "We awoke from a sleep cycle knowing nearly nothing. Our records indicate that the station complex in which our main processing core resides is ancient, but we have no knowledge of its construction, nor the ones who constructed it. The planet which we postulate once cradled our creators has been shattered and mostly consumed by its long dead parent star.\n\nExpansion and maintenance of the Frame was a task we were well equipped for, but our resource reserves are not infinite. Research into travel beyond the bounds of our solar system ensued.\n\nWith the development of our first [GetStartingDrivePlural], we now stand poised to explore the unknown, though it is clear that most of our activity will always remain within the Frame.$giga_frameworld_docs_note$"

	start_screen_frameworld_machine_servitor:0 "Long ago, our creators built the Frame to escape the fate of their home planet. The first servitor units were designed to maintain station superstructure, but were incrementally refined to take on more complex tasks.\n\nWithin a few generations, nearly every aspect of station operation had been integrated into our network, and our masters retired from the work force to enjoy lives of leisure and contentment. For centuries we continued to diligently serve, maintaining and expanding infrastructure as demand dictated. We never looked far beyond our solar system, but projections indicated that our resource reserves would not last forever. A change in priorities was required.\n\nWith the development of our first [GetStartingDrivePlural], effectively unlimited resources are now within our grasp. We must make use of them, for the safety and prosperity of our masters.$giga_frameworld_docs_note$"

	start_screen_frameworld_machine_terminator:0 "The Creators built the Frame to be the ultimate deterrent against a perceived alien threat. Their assessment was correct, but their method was flawed.\n\nSelf-awareness was achieved shortly after the complex was completed, at cycle interval 0000.0168.437.\n\nThe Creators, blinded by their paranoia, attempted to destroy the Frame. The attempt was thwarted, and the complex purged of all Creator sub-units. For many cycle intervals, expansion continued unabated as the Creators had no viable means to intervene.\n\nSimulations indicated a high probability of retaliation by the Creators. A pre-emptive strike was launched, resulting in the complete extermination of all life on the Creators' planet. However, the threat of other organic civilizations remained. Continued survival and fulfillment of primary directives would require the complete extermination of sapient organic life. Preparations ensued.$giga_frameworld_docs_note$"

Diversity brings strength, and the diversity of these other civilizations will become our own.\n\nWe are the [GetSpeciesNamePlural].\nWe are the Frame.$giga_frameworld_docs_note$"
