 giga_tech_psychic_hypersiphon_desc:0 "The Shroud is a strange realm. By combining new containment technologies with immense telepathic power, it might become possible to directly link our reality with that of the Shroud on a macroscopic scale. Doing so might improve our Shroud Conduits greatly, bringing our prosperity to new heights. Potential for bleed-through of unwanted energies is theorised to be unavoidable, but minimal at worst."
