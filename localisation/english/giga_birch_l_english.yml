A few hyperlanes leading to the core will be created upon completion, so our scientists advise starting the project after ensuring our rivals won't be able to use them.

While many attempts have been made in past to map regions far from our home insula, they have been comparatively small and poorly equipped, and found little of use in the vast wilderness.\n\nNow that we have seen the Structure from space and understand its true immensity, it is imperative that our [GigaGetExplorerPlural] have the equipment and supplies they need for excursions of such epic scale.\n\nExpedition Leader [giga_birch_expedition_leader.GetName] has been assigned to spearhead the operation, leading a combined land, sea, and air force large enough to travel the extreme distances required while maintaining most of their own supply chain.\n\nWe don't know what we'll find out there, but we hope that it can at least shed some light on the true nature of this ancient structure."

Not much is left to help us understand exactly what they were like, as no remains have been found, and all storage media found have decayed beyond recognition. All we can say for certain is that they had a different body plan to our own, as their tools and fixtures are alien in design.\n\nExpedition Leader [giga_birch_expedition_leader.GetName] has suggested that we establish a forward base of operations at the site, as this mystery could become a subject of long term study.
