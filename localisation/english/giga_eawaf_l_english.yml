  giga_eawaf.1001.name:0 "The Blinking Star"
  giga_eawaf.1001.desc:0 "Ever since our species first began charting the stars - initially through primitive optical telescopes, then via orbital satellites, and now with tachyonic emitters - there have always been a number of systems behaving in unexpected ways.\n\nThe most common causes of confusion amongst our astronomers were usually variations in stellar luminosity and irregular exoplanet transit patterns, but as our understandings of physics grew, these mysteries were able to be properly assessed, analysed, and solved. Most of the time, they turned out to be little more than simple erroneous measurements by our primitive telescopes, and in the reminder of cases, the study of these phenomena allowed us to further enhance our understanding of exoplanets and stellar behavior.\n\nYet, despite the continuous perfectioning of our telescopes and our ever-increasing comprehension of the cosmos, one system in particular continues to utterly defy all models of astrophysics - the mysterious star referred to as §YFaust§!. While it might at first look like a regular - if dim - star, anyone spending more than a couple hours observing the system will notice the star seemingly just... disappearing, before reappearing again roughly twelve hours later, and again disappearing twelve more hours afterwards.\n\nDubbed the 'Blinking Star' by our astronomers, no theory has managed to explain the star's regular disappearance and it has become evident that the only way to pierce this mystery would be to go there ourselves. Fortunately, with the recent discovery of Faster-than-Light travel, such a direct investigation is at last within the realm of possibility, and the prospect of finally solving this mystery already has our entire scientific community abuzz with excitment."

  giga_eawaf.1010.desc:0 "The §Y[ROOT.GetName]§! has reached the §YFaust§! system, in order to hopefully bring the solution to the mysterious 'Blinking Star' phenomenon which has stumped astronomers and scientists alike for centuries.\n\nAnd, in an ironic twist of fate, this solution laid not in our most advanced theories, but rather in the very first and erroneous interpretation of space which our species came up with to explain the movement of the stars in the heaven - Geocentrism.\n\nThe §YFaust§! system is, somehow, centered around Faust itself, a telluric world around which several smaller planets (or moons) orbit alongside nothing less than a miniature sun providing heat and warmth to Faust.\n\nMeasurements of the star's spectral emissions show that it behaves more or less like a typical G-class star although its diameter is no more than three thousand kilometers. With such a small size, it should by all accounts either be a neutron star or little more than a gas giant, and yet... there it is, dutifully orbiting around Faust in twenty-four hours, passing behind the planet every twelve hours and disappearing from view before re-emerging on the other side.\n\nWhile the 'Blinking Star' mystery is finally solved, it seems there will still be much work to do before we actually have any idea what is happening within this strange system."

It is a relatively large rocky moon pockmarked with numerous impact craters owing to its lack of atmosphere and covered with a thin layer of fine moon dust much like many other natural satellites.\n\nThe first signs of abnormality ironically came when the §Y[ROOT.GetName]§!'s crew began to rest. As soon as they got close to the moon, the crew's usually pleasant dreams began turning into atrocious nightmares with most of them reporting that they were visited by a dark and imposing equine figure in their sleep, bearing promises of vengeance and eternal darkness shrouding entire worlds.\n\nWhile these nightmares subsided as soon as the ship departed from the moon, many now believe the celestial body to be 'haunted' by an unknown vengeful spirit, and [Owner.GetScientist] §Y[ROOT.GetLeaderName]§! seems to have been profoundly impacted by these night terrors..."

  giga_eawaf.1013.desc:0 "It was hoped that a closer inspection of §YHelios§! might shed some light on the mysterious celestial body, and yet it continues to behave in seemingly impossible ways.\n\nFirst and foremost, both Helios and Selene's orbital periods of twenty-four hours are far shorter than what they should be, with calculations based on Faust's mass estimating that they should logically take roughly two weeks to orbit around the planet.\n\nAdditionally, while their orbits remain circular and predictable, the two bodies are prone to near-imperceptible 'jittering' at seemingly random points along their orbits, as if they were suddenly being 'pulled' by some unexplained force.\n\nObviously, expecting orbits to function normally in a system where stars go around planets is already quite unreasonable, but these discrepancies only adds to the ever-growing pile of unsolved mysteries surrounding Faust.\n\nFurthermore, the star seems to be pulling energy from quite literally nowhere, as it is outputting far more radiation than any known fusion process could ever generate, in some cases even breaking the fundamental principle of mass-energy equivalence."

  giga_eawaf.1014.desc:0 "As if the system wasn't enough of an oddity, not only is its central world of §YFaust§! fully inhabitable thanks to Helios' light, but a flurry of radio emissions emanating from its surface betrays the fact that the world is, in fact, inhabited!\n\nThe planet is shared by roughly a dozen species, all fully sapient and capable of complex thought, who have achieved a level of technological development roughly equivalent to the machine age. However, many of these species, notably the more equine ones, display a variety of supernatural abilities, such as ludicrously efficient agriculture, flight or telekinesis, to name a few.\n\nSignificant deposits of the thaumaturgic crystals found in the system's asteroid belt have also been located all across the world, with some of its native species making significant usage of them in order to bolster and catalyse their natural abilities. This has led our scientists to believe the crystals and these abilities to be related in some way.\n\nInterestingly enough, we may be right in time to witness a turning point in the planet's history, as several species are reaching the point at which developments in experimental methods should allow them to tremendously increase their own understandings of both their abilities and the crystals. This is likely to have far-reaching consequences and might drastically alter their technological development.\n\nThe §Y[ROOT.GetName]§! reports that a small team has been deployed to the surface in order to hopefully gleam more insight into the workings of this peculiar multispecies civilization before a more permanent observation post is established."

  giga_eawaf.10141.desc:0 "Our expedition down to the surface of §YFaust§! has mostly gone without any significant issues, all while bring in copious amounts of data regarding the planet's native civilization, or civilizations rather.\n\nThe planet's dry land is split into three large landmasses, the two smaller northern ones being dubbed §YEquus§! and §YGriffonia§!, while the larger one, known as §YZebrica§!, is located almost entirely within the southern hemisphere. These continents are incredibly diverse, with each of them harboring several distinct sapient species.\n\nWhile native species range from bipedal humanoids known as §YYetis§! to four-legged ursines known simply as §YBears§! and avians known as §YGriffons§!, a significant chunk of these species resembles equine creatures and have thus been dubbed §YEquineans§!.\n\nThis is however an umbrella term encompassing several species, such as particularly small yet thaumaturgically gifted §YPonies§! (which, alongside the Griffons, are by far the most populous species, being present on all three continents), the §YZebras§! adapted to desertic climates, the larger §YHorses§!, and the more outlandish §YKirins§! native to the easternmost side of Zebrica.\n\nHowever, perhaps the most interesting yet dangerous feature of Faust is the existence of several demigod-like entities roaming the planet's surface. Known as §YAlicorns§!, they are gifted with tremendously powerful reality-warping abilities and seem to act as the mostly-undisputed rulers of §YEquestria§!, the planet's most powerful nationstate.\n\nThe consensus amongst our expedition members is that the sheer power of these Alicorns means any invasion attempt of Faust would be §Rextremely ill-advised§!, and thus it is likely far safer to simply observe the world from afar."

As systems are constantly moving through space, our scientists concluded that there must be some sort of phenomenon causing this 'thinning' of reality, and set out to probe Helios itself to try and find answers.\n\nThanks to thermal-shielded probes diving into the depths of this esoteric inferno, it was found that at the core of Helios lies a miniature 'rift' in reality itself, supposedly leading directly into a realm of pure psionic energy.Matter from Helios' center regularly falls into this rift before re-emerging in the form of boiling superheated psionic energy. This energy then 'floats' up to Helios' hydrogen outer layers and triggers nuclear fusion reactions.\n\nThrough poorly-understood processes, the 'spent' psionic energy then 'coalesces' back into hydrogen nuclei, which are themselves ignited by fresh psionic energy. The fused helium nuclei, owing to their higher mass, then fall into the rift and the cycle repeats essentially indefinitely, thus keeping the miniature star lit!\n\nThe discovery and understanding of this esoteric process, now dubbed §YPsicatalyzed Fusion§!, has revolutionized both psionics and nuclear science. Consequently, many of our scientists are now debating whether it is possible to replicate this process ourselves in order to generate energy."

Hydrogen nuclei were then injected onto the emerging energies with perfect timing, triggering extremely powerful nuclear fusion reactions several orders of magnitude more powerful than those found within conventional fusion reactors, or even normal stars, for that matter.\n\nWith the initial experimental hurdle out of the way, the potential application for this technology are limitless. Not only does it generate significant quantities of energy, the more powerful fusion reactions could theoretically be used to create extremely heavy elements with far greater ease than current methods. Not only that, but the stabilized rifts seemed to produce a 'reality thinning' effect much like the one found on Faust, drastically improving the efficiency of psionics within its immediately vicinity.\n\nFollowing this resounding success, all that remains to be done now is to upscale the design to be industrially viable."

  # Sirens Event Chain
  giga_eawaf.2001.name:0 "The Depths Awaken"
  giga_eawaf.2001.desc:0 "Something is stirring on Faust's surface. Seapony explorers from §YHippogriffia§!, a nation located on the northwestern end of Zebrica, have recently undertaken an expedition into the depths of the §YMareiana Trench§!, one of the deepest, darkest chasms of Faust's vast oceans.\n\nWhen the explorers returned, something within them had changed. Some sort of mysterious presence had taken hold of them, as if their very souls had been enthralled. That presence began spreading to other Seaponies, taking a hold of their minds and spreading its influence across the nation of Hippogriffia.\n\nWithin mere weeks this influence had spread to the point of culminating in a relatively bloodless coup which saw the former Hippogriffian government overthrown and the instauration of the §YSirens§!, a trio of serpentine mind-controlling demons from the depths evidently behind the entire act, as the new rulers of the land which they now call §YSirenalia§!.\n\nFrom what our outpost could gather, these Sirens are seemingly driven by an intense desire for revenge over some long-forgotten catastrophe which had befallen their kind. It is thus evident that they do not intend to stop at merely Hippogriffia and are likely to try and spread their influence to the rest of Zebrica and potentially even all of Faust itself.\n\nThe task at hand is daunting, though. Already, a resistance group known as the §YAris Resistance§! and made up of notable Hippogriffian officials, including its former queen, has arisen to counter the rise of Sirenalia and end the Sirens' rule over their rightful land, and it is anyone's guess as to whether or not they will be successful in restoring the old order.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, it would be in our best interest to keep a close eye on this situation."

This song appears to be powered by peculiar crystals lodged within the Sirens themselves, although the actual mechanisms of this enthralling remain entirely unknown to us.\n\nThis ability is what allows the Sirens to actively impose their control, and already they are leveraging this power in order to try and secure several of Sirenalia's neighboring nationstates.\n\nWith Sirenalia possessing a particularly large navy as well as a powerful airforce, both inherited from the former Hippogriffian goverment, we estimate that the Sirens will have little trouble expanding their influence to the rest of Northern Zebrica within the coming years.\n\nAs for the rest of Faust, while some are expressing concern over the Sirens' growth, most are currently disregarding the Sirens as yet another empire doomed to inevitably meet its end at the hands of a future coalition."

Ultimately however, and with plenty of support from §YEquestria§!, the harmonic resistance stands victorious as the Sirens' order collapses in on itself and their enthralling magic, bereft of sustenance, simply fades away.\n\nA new, united Hippogriffian government has been established to restore the old status quo, while the whereabouts of the Sirens themselves is unknown. They have either perished in the fighting, or have returned to the depths of the oceans to once again gather power and perhaps bide their time in preparation for another attempt at planetary domination.\n\nBut for the foreseeable future, the Hippogriffians can rest knowing that the Sirens are no longer a threat, at least for the next few centuries."

While our scientists were originally rather confused as to why the Sirens decided to pick such a powerful enemy as their next target, further studies revealed that a group of individuals known as the §YPillars of Equestria§! seemingly caused the Sirens' downfall many millennia ago.\n\nOriginating from Equestria itself, these 'Pillars' were, against all odds, found to be still alive, and thus the Sirens appear to be determined to enact vengeance upon the Pillars for their previous banishment into the depths of the Mareiana Trench.\n\nThis upcoming war is certain to be one of tremendous proportions, likely the largest Faust has known thus far. Already the Sirens have taken to conquering more nations in key geographical locations, namely §YMaregypt§! and §YAbyssinia§! to their southwest, in order to use them as staging grounds for the future invasion of Equestria.\n\nGiven Equestria's power, many of Faust's inhabitants believe that this is likely to end in the Sirens' untimely demise, but the Sirens themselves seem determined to exe cute this ambitious plan to the end."

In order to ensure Sirenalia could never emerge again, the Pillars of Equestria alongside the Alicorns pooled their powers to banish the Sirens' very souls into the depths of the Immaterium, where they should remain imprisoned for at least several millennia.\n\nWith Sirenalia defeated and its rulers themselves banished from reality, the Sirens' hope of world domination have been definitively thwarted."

Across the world's surface, two billion sapients have fallen under the Sirens' enthralling spell, toiling endlessly to fuel Sirenalia's ever-growing industrial might.\n\nWith the entire world under their control, it seems evident that the next step for the Sirens might just be to take to the stars, although the means by which they would do so are unclear.

  GIGA_EAWAF_DISENCHANTER_1:0 "Prototype Disenchanter"
  GIGA_EAWAF_DISENCHANTER_1_DESC:0 "An early version of a device capable of countering the Sirens' enthralling song by emitting specifically-attuned energetic noise around the ship. These prototypes are unfortunately expensive and extremely power-hungry, requiring significant input of external energy and material in order to keep them running."
  
  GIGA_EAWAF_DISENCHANTER_2:0 "Tuned Disenchanter"
  GIGA_EAWAF_DISENCHANTER_2_DESC:0 "This improved and streamlined Disenchanter builds upon earlier prototypes to more efficiently counter the Sirens' song through energetic noise. While they do not impede the ship's movement quite as much, the sheer complexity involved in generating just the right psionic noise entails ever-growing logistical requirements as these devices matures."

  GIGA_EAWAF_DISENCHANTER_3:0 "Symphonious Disenchanter"
  GIGA_EAWAF_DISENCHANTER_3_DESC:0 "The continued sophistication of Disenchanters not only nullify the Outer Field, but at last enable these novel designs to venture into the Sirens' Inner Field. Maintenance costs however continue to increase."

  GIGA_EAWAF_DISENCHANTER_4_DESC:0 "This perfect Disenchanter design enables our vessels to completely counter the effects of the Sirens' enthralling song, rendering them essentially immune to everything the Sirens might be able to throw at us.

  GIGA_EAWAF_CRYSTAL_AUTOCANNON_DESC:0 "These autocannons spray a flurry of razor-sharp thaumaturgic crystals which, while they struggle to puncture thick armor and are generally stopped clean by shields, can absolutely devastate the more fragile hull of energy starships if it happens to be exposed."
